I want to add a doorbell. There's the wired and battery version of the S330. Is the S330 Add-on wired or battery? Or is it a battery version that can also be hardwired. Then, there seems to be a standalone S330 that stores files within the doorbell itself, so no base station. Does that standalone unit also pair with a basestation? Which of these S330 units work seamlessly with the homebase 2?   I could get the E340, but will it work with the Homebase 2, which I already own? Does the E340 have a wired version to purchase?

I have an existing standard household chime, which I would prefer to continue to use, but can it work with the wired version of either the S330 or E340?  Would it make sense for me to purchase a new E340 with basestation 3? Is there enough improvements to make that jump and would my older pro cam 2's still work?

Faulty camera?,2,1f1iypw,https://www.reddit.com/r/EufyCam/comments/1f1iypw/faulty_camera/,"Hi, I've had a Homebase 2 running for 3 years with 2x 2C Pro & 1x 2 Pro, overall it's been a good setup with only minor glitches here & there.

I've now discovered live view doesn't work on this camera either, with a ""can't connect to homebase"" error when it tries to stream. However, my other 2 cameras have no such issues. I've tried resetting the whole system & the camera individually, re-installed the app, changed router wifi channels, and have placed the camera right next to the Homebase incase it was a signal issue, but the problem remains. I noticed there was a recent firmware update, could this have bricked my camera & has anyone else had issues? Or has it just served 3 solid years outside & gone faulty with age?

Eufy removes 24/7 recording ability from the E330 Pros in Wifi mode!,6,1f13b5f,https://www.reddit.com/r/EufyCam/comments/1f13b5f/eufy_removes_247_recording_ability_from_the_e330/,"I have a homebase 3 which is connected via Wifi along with 2 E330 Pros (and other cams/accesories) that have been running in 24/7 recording mode the whole time I’ve had them which is almost a year now.   After one of the recent app updates the E330 settings have a Homebase connection option and in there you can select “only events” or “continuous recording and events”.  Somehow my settings got changed to “only events”.  I cannot switch back to continuous recording as it is greyed out and in red text underneath it says, “Homebase 3 is in Wi-Fi connection and could not store continuous recording”.    It had been working completely fine like this for almost a year but they’ve made this change now and I cannot use the continuous recording option anymore which is the whole point of these cameras.   I tried resetting/re-installing/etc with no luck.    I emailed Eufy support and this is the response I received:  > We understand the frustration caused by the inability to enable continuous recording for your E330 Pro camera after the recent app update. To re-enable continuous recording, please ensure that the HomeBase 3 is not in Wi-Fi repeater mode, as this can affect the storage of continuous recordings. Connect the HomeBase 3 to the router using an Ethernet cable to resolve this issue. You can check the Wi-Fi connection mode in the app by navigating to HomeBase Settings > General > Connection. Our engineers are actively working to improve this functionality for a better user experience in the future.  I don’t have the option to easily wire my homebase to Ethernet so this is essentially rendering my cameras useless.  How in the world can they get away with removing core functionality like this that the purchase was based on?  Even if you go to the E330 store page right now it advertises the ability to hook up the homebase anywhere without wires along with the camera’s 24/7 functionality.  Nowhere does it state that the homebase must be wired because that has never been the case previously.   Has anyone else ran into this issue and maybe come up with a workaround?  Running Ethernet to my homebase would be a huge task and extra expense which seems ridiculous considering it was working fine prior to this.",14,2024-08-25 18:31:38

Right now if I walk across the view of these cameras I'll get motion notifications every 1-3 seconds while walking by even though that should really count as a single event imho(and is how my old Kuna system treated it). I can't seem to find any settings in the app for limiting the frequency of notifications though, and am curious what this experience is like for others here. So far after only a few days of using these I'm now averaging 109 notifications a day when my Kuna setup would send maybe 4-5 a day. It really bothered me when my phone basically buzzed every 3 seconds for ten minutes straight while I was in a work meeting yesterday because my landscaper was mowing the yard. I don't want to disable notifications entirely though, as I like to know when someone is in my yard or driveway.   Is it possible my system is just not working properly? Does anyone else here get a barrage of notifications every time something is moving across their camera's field of view, and just learned to ignore it? I wish there was a setting would let me set a minimum time before any of the cameras could send another notification, but their support only referred me to settings I already knew about which is to limit notifications by type(human or motion in general), but not in frequency.",4,2024-08-21 21:45:37

The doorbell is installed with a strong wifi connection. It is connected via Homebase 3.

This occurs whether I am using my Android phone or my Ipad, and whether or not I am on cellular or wifi with my phone.  I have tried updating the firmware as this thread here  [https://community.security.eufy.com/t/eufy-video-doorbell-p2p-connection-failure/729873](https://community.security.eufy.com/t/eufy-video-doorbell-p2p-connection-failure/729873)  suggests that updating from [3.0.7.1](http://3.0.7.1) to [3.0.7.7](http://3.0.7.7) will help.

Eufy have told me to connect via mobile hotspot, then press the doorbell button, then request firmware update - but this did not work, in fact I received an ""unable to connect to eufy server"" error using this method.  I assumed the reason for using the mobile hotspot was to make sure no ports were being blocked, so I set up my Homebase 3 as a DMZ on my router to allow all ports through but the problem still persists.  I am very suspicious it is a problem with how the doorbell accesses the network - it is somehow broken unless motion is activated.

I picked up some of the spherical Eufy OutdoorCams and connected them via Eero pro 6Es to an M2 Mac mini running SecuritySpy.   This setup runs flawlessly with a reasonably high frame rate (15fps) and no packet loss, and two of the cameras are located about 150 feet (50 meters) from the nearest access point.    I like these cameras, they are cheap and easy to mount, have decent quality and support RTSP. So I decided to get a few to use at my home.  Same setup: Cameras connect through Eero pro 6Es to an M2 Mac mini running SecuritySpy.   This setup however, is far from flawless. Max frame rate is 2 fps with near 100% packet loss. The packet loss occurs ONLY with the Eufy cameras. I have a wifi Reolink doorbell with no packet loss and 15 fps which is located about six feet (2 meters) from one of the Eufy cameras. No other devices on the network give me any trouble.   The Eufy app on my iPhone and iPad connect without issue to the cameras, both locally and remote. Live and recorded video on the app have a high frame rate and are very sharp.   I have tried moving the cameras to different locations, no change.  I set up a separate wifi network with a non-Eero AP, no change.  I have reset the cameras and reconnected, reset RTSP and reconnected, no change.  This seems to narrow the problem down to the M2 Mac mini and SecuritySpy, but this combination works perfectly at the vacation house.  I have contacted support at SecuritySpy but this kind of issue is extremely hard to diagnose and I am not convinced the problem is at their end.   Does anyone have any suggestions or troubleshooting tips for me?  I am kind of stuck at this point.   Update:  I took one of the cameras with high packet loss and low frame rate up to the vacation house and connected it to SecuritySpy there. It works fine, zero packet loss and a solid 15 fps, so it looks like the problem must be with SecuritySpy and the M2 Mac mini I have running at home.   ",3,2024-08-18 15:37:50

Eufy App Events Timestamp Difficulties Across Timezones,2,1eu1llr,https://i.redd.it/ivh2rwlro3jd1.jpeg,"Depending on the Eufy product, the timestamp events in the Eufy App don't match other eufy cameras.  I have 16 Eufy cameras set up on 2 houses that are located in a different time zone (central time zone) from where I'm normally at (pacific time zone). The Timestamps on all of the video recordings display correct local time (central time zone) but the Eufy App differs in displaying the event time for Homebase2 linked Battery cameras vs IndoorCam2k & IndoorCam Pan&Tilt cameras.  The app will list events from EufyCam2C cameras at my local time (PST)  while it will list events from IndoorCams and pan&tilt ones at the camera's local time (CST) which is 2 hours ahead.    This makes it difficult to sort events in order when an issue happens on camera.  I think this is a bug in the Eufy App as all my cameras are set to correct timezone in settings.  See attached eufy screenshot: Same house, 2 events recorded with the app saying they are 16 minutes apart, but vastly different daylight levels prove one is reporting in pacific time time and 1 is reporting in central time zone.

S220 Camera dragging WiFi network down,1,1enpfnn,https://www.reddit.com/r/EufyCam/comments/1enpfnn/s220_camera_dragging_wifi_network_down/,"So I set my parent’s S220 wireless solar outdoor camera up. I hooked it up to their WiFi network (I believe it’s Optimum), and it didn’t want to connect at first so I did the easiest first thing of resetting their router which worked, but while the camera connected fine, it also kicked an iPad off the network. No biggie just reset the router again before I left and it seemed to work at first. Then my mom calls me the next day and said her iPad isn’t connecting to the WiFi, and also their Apple TV app isn’t working, they said it just spins and spins and never loads and they have to keep resetting the router for it to work for a short while then back to same issue. I told them to take the camera and reset it so it drops it off the network to see what happens, and now the other devices work normally again. The issue is obviously something with the camera, I’m just wondering what I should be looking into to resolve this. I’m not gonna be able to get over there for a few days so I don’t want to call Eufy support at the moment because I won’t be able to do much without being there. Just wondering if anyone else has heard of or ran into this issue and maybe has some quick tips? 🤨",0,2024-08-09 03:18:28

Then you will have to set up the camera on app and once it’s register with the. 7 day free trial you can go to settings general and about to find IMEi.

No notification sound? S350,2,1el9z41,https://i.redd.it/3ame4ixuezgd1.jpeg,"Hi good people.  I am writing here since the Eufy aka Anker support is useless. First they told me that I need to check the power mode but when I couldn't find it, they said that that the option is only for the battery powered cameras...  I am attaching the last answer. This makes no sense at all.   So, I have a Android Phone and a do not Disturb mode during some hours. I have added the app as an exception and I get the notification, but it doesn't play the sound of the notification. Btw, how is it not possible to set a custom sound or have a normal longer sound as a notification?   Anyway, I have a Ring Camera and it works like that just fine, I get the notification with the sound, but since it's battery powered, I just wanted something that I didn't have to charge.     So, I've played with it. Took down the Ring app, removed it from my exception list and it all works as intended, but when I do the same for Eufy Security App, it lights up the screen, but no sound is being played.   Hopefully you can see how this is troublesome, especially during the night, when one usually has a do not Disturb mode.   In addition, this AI following options is really bad. It detects me, but since I am too fast, it doesn't react and stays in the place. Or if I turn on to catch all movement, then, even on the lowest setting, it catches dust flying. At this point, that is good since I don't get sound notification , even the super short sound which I would definitely miss during night, but I get 5 of them. Just no sound.   Is there any other solution or how to contact second level support since this guys are pretty much useless?   I am really thinking about returning the camera, since my 3 year old Ring has far superior software. Picture quality on S350 is amazing, but the software and the support is incredibly bad.

While I’m nearby on cell service, I am able to access and utilize the device. But will disconnect suddenly. It’s unusable when I’m away on cell service.   I currently have a HB3 that is Ethernet connected with WiFi backup. The e340 is connected through the HB3 and I have attempted for strictly WiFi connection  WiFi is AltaFiber (fiber optic connection) with 2 Google WiFi Mesh with 600mbps speeds  I apologize if this has been answered, I haven’t been able to find anything through searching on YouTube , Reddit, or Eufy forms. TYIA! _____ Update: Disconnected the HB3/E340 and only connected the E340 to WiFi, which is now functioning great. HB3 was connected and has not resolved the issue. I have another HB3 that I ordered by accident and might attempt to connect to see if the HB3 that I have could be a lemon. Will update if there is any resolution.   ______ Update 2: I decided to use only the E340 connected to WiFi. Since then, I’ve had no issues. I get alerts appropriately, I can connect remotely without any issue, I placed an SSD in the camera and it has worked like a dream!

Homebase 3 S380 Corrupted During Firmware Update/ Eufy Won't Replace,3,1eh1h6j,https://www.reddit.com/r/EufyCam/comments/1eh1h6j/homebase_3_s380_corrupted_during_firmware_update/,"Had a support chain going with eufy about my homebase 3 corrupting after a firmware update on July 9th. Went round and round and thought i was about to get a replacement and they reversed and said they wouldn't replace it now. They offered a 10% coupon to buy a new one :-|  SOOOOO. That's obviously frustrating. I spent a lot of money on this security system and have other cameras now that won't work. I don't feel like I have any other options besides buying a new homebase to get back to where I was before eufy deployed this bad update.  I was wondering if anyone else here has ever done a credit card chargeback and the implications of doing this? A lot of my system is now worthless and unusable due to an action taken by eufy, and they won't honor the implied warranty.  >""According to the troubleshooting you take, given that your HomeBase failed due to the firmware update, so even though you are out of warranty, would you like us make a replacement for you? If so, you can reach me directly by replying to this email, and we will offer you a return label. After we receive the defective item, we will replace an order for you.""",10,2024-07-31 23:13:51

Some things I've tried include  * Remove and re-add the cameras to HomeKit * Introduce an Apple TV into my network to make it the primary HomeKit hub * Make sure the Apple TV is on ethernet instead of WiFi * Move the AppleTV to be on the same switch as the HomeBase 2 in case some bizarre networking topology issue was causing problems * Made sure firmware/software is up to date on everything - cameras, home base, Apple stuff, etc.     For context, I've got two Eero Pro 6E wifi base stations connected to each other via ethernet powering Wifi around my house. From one of the Eero's I have a links's dumb switch where the HomeBase and AppleTV are connected. The camera's themselves are all within about 20-100 ft of the HomeBase and everything works fine in the Eufy app. So by basic process of elimination I'm figuring there is something weird going on between the HomeBase and AppleTV (i.e. with HomeKit integration).

I used a 0.05 hex head allen wrench with a МЗХО, 50Х4 set screw.   My screw is silver as that is the only one I could find, but if that bothers you then you can install it and use a black permanent marker to color the top so it'll blend in and not be so noticeable.

VOX mode turning off cycle cameras on Eufy Spaceview ,1,1ecytw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/EufyCam/comments/1ecytw5/vox_mode_turning_off_cycle_cameras_on_eufy/,"Hello! We recently got a Eufy Spaceview and are having an issue with VOX, sleep mode and cycling cameras. I have the VOX mode on and the camera screen off at night since I'm a light sleeper and little kid sleeping grunts wake me easily. The VOX is set to level 3 and we have issues with it when cycling cameras. If something makes noise and activates the screen, then the camera is stuck and no longer rotates. For example, if my toddler rolls into the side of the crib but keeps sleeping, the noise will be loud enough to turn the monitor screen on to the camera in his room but then it's stuck there. So even though the cycle cameras setting is still turned on, the monitor is stuck on camera #1. This has resulted in a quick noise waking the monitor and staying stuck on camera #1, so then when the baby is crying on camera #2 the monitor never switches over.   I contacted customer support and they had me reset the monitor, then they sent me a replacement, but the replacement is having the same issue. Has anyone experienced this and found a fix? My current solution is to sleep with the monitor screen on all night but I get woken up way more to little grunts this way!",0,2024-07-26 21:00:54

So I was hoping that having the Chime would allow me to hear the doorbell.   I hooked up the Chime synced it to the Homebase3, but, the doorbell settings under chime options only give me three options:   -Eufy Chime (but only the USB version that connects into the Homebase)   -Homebase 3   -Alexa  I honestly can't figure out what the point of this chime even is if you have a Homebase. Is it only useful if you didn't have a homebase to store the video from the Video Lock?   How can I get this chime to play the doorbell, AND can I have it chime and the homebase chime as well or only one?

I am wanting to purchase a cellular security camera to monitor my horse while she is in her stall while at horse shows. I’ll probably also find another spot at home to use it while not at a show. I know there will be some set-up for each show but I’m not too worried about that.  However, how strong does signal strength need to be? The barns at shows are typically very large metal and/or concrete buildings and service isn’t always the best. Fortunately, shows are typically in urban areas with excellent coverage.

First impressions switching from ring to eufy.,12,1eb0gu2,https://www.reddit.com/r/EufyCam/comments/1eb0gu2/first_impressions_switching_from_ring_to_eufy/,"I switched from ring to eufy recently mostly because I wanted the s330 doorlock doorbell combo and ring did not have any equivalent, and also because of the monthly fees.   Currently have the s330 smartlock doorbell and two s100 wall light cams.    Generaly satisfied with them BUT there are some things i'm missing from ring. Ability to take a snapshot every 30 seconds regardless of activity and timeline view in the app.  I liked that i could review the entire day on a timeline with all the events and the snapshots between them.  I live up north and battery powered outdoor cameras don't do very well in the winter, they drain extremely fast and solar panels will barely charge anything.   Ring's camera are very versatile in terms of power source and can be switched and even combined.   The plug in, hard wired, battery and solar models of the stickup for example are all the same camera, you just decided how you want to power them.   You can add a battery to a plugged in camera and it the power is cut it will switch to battery.   Eufy is more limited in this regard, most cameras are battery/solar operated,  thats why I went with  the S100.  They were a good fit and hardwiring is my preferred method.  I was okay with the smartlock doorbell to be battery operated because the battery is located inside the house instead of outside like the ring doorbells.  Its unfortunate that not all cameras offer hardwiring especially since from a technical perspective it's the most simple and least expensive.  I did not opt for the homebase yet.   I find the app a bit annoying in this regard as everything is designed to upsell me the homebase and feels more like a shopping app than a security app.   I want to check on my cameras, not be told constantly what features i'm missing for not spending more money. The ring app is better overall and more focused on what you actually want to see.   I also wished the app would let me limit the number of notifications i get within a short time.   I'll sometimes get  a bunch notifications in 2 minutes for say my wife leaving the house getting to her car and then the kids following, wife going back in the house to get her purse, etc.   I'll get 5 notifications for the same event.

On 5/28 they made a pricing error, or so they claimed; 4 S220 cameras for $160. For a month that went out of stock; they did not place it out for orders until more recently. Originally they claimed they are backlogged for 3 months due to supply issues on the days after the incident. Today, they are obviously still selling this bundle of 4 cameras but is in stock (just checked in eufy store and amazon). I reached out to CS live chat in hopes getting this expedited, as some reported success of having them ship it the next day. The US phone number did not work and kept dropping the call after pressing the CORRECT choices on dialpad (fix your automated calls Eufy). When in live chat, they reported that purchases on that day forward were still back ordered (obviously a lie) and promptly tried to get me to refund. After refusing, CS then tells me again that order stating that price was made in error. Funny how I filled out the form that was sent when they firstly acknowledged their mistake and were going to honor it.  And this is now the kicker, the CS live chat agent then tells me they've accidentally cancelled my order and is unable to reorder it for me as they are ""out of stock."" The guy then casually adds you should see a refund on the original payment source in 3-4 business days before ending the chat. I was shook at this point and reopened chat trying to get back in touch with this support agent or to follow up on this matter. New guy, claims they have no idea and was unable to help me further as refund was made already.

Apple HomeKit Support,0,1eajqr2,https://www.reddit.com/r/EufyCam/comments/1eajqr2/apple_homekit_support/,What’s up with HomeKit support with Eufy? I was surprised to discover only a few are HomeKit compatible (EufyCam Pro 2 and 2C Pro?). It seems the newer and better cameras do not support HomeKit from Eufy. Am I wrong? Should I be looking elsewhere if I want to integrate with HomeKit? I hear a lot about Homebridge…is it possible to use it with Eufy? Is it worth the hassle? I’d prefer something to work out of the box. I use my Apple TV as a hub so I feel limited :(. ,5,2024-07-23 21:31:54

Solocam s40 quality and durability issues,9,1eaa6i8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1eaa6i8,"PSA: I've had Eufy Solocam S40 for two years. Mine has flaking top layer of solar panel, and discoloration (from water ingress?) into the housing. But the worst part is that the lens has some spots all over it which are impossible to clean. Maybe it's because it's poor quality plastic? Anyway, this results in foggy/blurry video feed. When it's humid outside (i.e after the rain) it's impossible to see anything. My theory is that mist builds up inside the lens assembly. Support said they won't replace it because it's past 12 months warranty period. So there's that.

Alternative to Eufy indoor camera ecosystem?,2,1e7xlhz,https://www.reddit.com/r/EufyCam/comments/1e7xlhz/alternative_to_eufy_indoor_camera_ecosystem/,"I was just outside the warranty period by about two weeks when I contacted Eufy regarding multiple (3 out of 4) Indoor Cam 2k devices randomly going offline and being a bear to get back online (needing multiple power cycles).  Fortunately my four other S220 cameras and video doorbell are still functioning (for now).  This issue started several weeks before I contacted support, and I figured I'd try to resolve the issue myself since it's intermittent and random.  Mistake on my part I suppose.  I was promptly told products are out of warranty and there's nothing they can do.  True, the products are out of warranty, but a 3 out of 4 failure rate all within a week points to a defective production run.  Plus the issue started just before warranty expired and I'm sure they would have me run through all the same troubleshooting steps I did myself.  This would most likely have lead to my warranty period expiring anyway since it can be days+ before the issue reoccurs.  Since Eufy/Anker abruptly cut communications without even an apology, I'm planning on ditching everything Eufy and Anker and no longer recommending their products.  Smart move losing future business and referrals over $120 in retail products.

Unbelievably disappointed ,0,1e6i56m,https://www.reddit.com/r/EufyCam/comments/1e6i56m/unbelievably_disappointed/,"I know this has been discussed. But now is my turn to gripe.   I just bought a whole slew of different eufy cameras.  2 Floodlight cams, indoor cams, outdoor cams, standalone, 3g, doorbell and the base station.   I was so excited and even my wife was feigning excitement, as well.  Upon arrival, I quickly installed the base station- easy peasy.  My excitement was only increased.  After two or three cameras, I tried the app.  Hmmm.  Where’s the typical security camera view where you can see 1/2/4/9 cameras thumbnails on one screen?   I’ll come back to that.  So I tried HomeKit.   Nope.  None of the new eufy cameras are compatible with HomeKit.  Neither is the base or the doorbell.  So, in my opinion, this entire system is dogshit.  No real live view?  No ability to monitor two or more cameras LIKE EVERY OTHER SECURITY CAMERA SYSTEM EVER?   No HomeKit?    If my kid is pushing on a window screen, hopefully I’ll get the notification of “movement” after which I can click “view it” and wait for a video clip to load so I can watch the video of my kid pushing on the screen.   Then I can switch over to the live camera view to see that the screen is actually gone now.  But I can’t look at the backyard camera at the same time, so I have to go back to the Home Screen and scroll down through one camera at a time until I reach the back yard camera.  But - the app doesn’t simply show the live feed, so I have to drill into the camera still-framed thumbnail which takes me to the live feed where I can watch the kid crawl out of the hedge.  wtf man.  Every security camera system ever, in the world, times two, is able to view live feed from multiple channels.  Every one of them, for decades, figured out that you have a high-def main feed for recording and watching as a single feed, and a low def crap feed for watching multiple thumbnails at once.    Don’t get me started on no HomeKit on any of the new equipment.    I’m so disappointed.  I’m returning the whole mess. ",63,2024-07-18 18:20:35

Long connection times/timeout/unable to play live view  My Homebase 3 is connected via Ethernet with WiFi backup.I have 3 x Asus TUF AX6000 routers in AI Mesh and began to play with WiFi Channel settings. What I discovered solved the two main issues I've had since installing the Eufy Cams. Select a WiFi Channel on your router. In my case I used WiFi Analyzer to see the surrounding WiFi Networks. I selected the less occupied channel on the 2.4Ghz channel. The best channels with less interference on 2.4Ghz is 1, 6 and 11, as they don't overlap other channels. I HIGHLY recommend if you suffer from any of above, change your WiFi 2.4Ghz to a dedicated channel and give it a go. Make sure your reboot your router and Homebase 3.",0,2024-07-18 08:01:55

My plan is to use HKSV, but it would be nice if I could also have a continuous local buffer as a backup.  I like that I can only get a single camera with the SoloCam, and I'd rather not find a place for the homebase, but are there limitations?

Outdoor camera - solar in an urban, cloudy environment?***  I live in a city and want to replace a failed Nest camera that was mounted to the front of the building; however, I don't want to drill another hole to run a different power cable. The battery+solar cameras seem promising; however, I'm not sure how much direct sunlight the panel might get.  The whole street is 3-5 story buildings, and the street itself is narrow, so there's a pretty limited window where there might be direct sun. On top of it, cloud cover is quite common.  Is solar even feasible under these conditions? My plan is to use HKSV, and I'm not sure if that helps or hurts  ***3. For the IndoorCam C120, is it possible to record to the SD card while HKSV is active?***  I disabled my existing C120s in the Eufy app after the security exposure a couple of years ago.

If you were to walk up however, you could just unscrew and walk off with the hardware. It's probably 6 foot in the air.   In the instance of someone walking off with the device, or smashing it and walking off, where is the footage stored? Is it lost/ stored inside the camera?

S380 Home Base - Red Ring of Death,2,1e4bj6d,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1e4bj6d,"TL;DR - my home base got the red ring of death, eufy won’t do anything about it. Have cameras that won’t connect to anything now.    I’ve had eufy products for 4 years now, starting with a home base and the eufy pro c cameras. I got several small tilt cameras to watch my dog and general security while I’m out and have generally been happy with them. There was a bug with the home vs away settings which failed to capture and record video for a couple days but even that I was willing to forgive.  Bought a s380 in November 2022, didn’t get it until late summer 2023 due to supply issues. Set it up, played around with the AI settings - seemed pretty good.  Purchased two more solar cams to replace the exterior cameras about 1.5 months ago. On Tuesday last week, the home base has a red ring on it. No big deal, I’ll just unplug it. Nothing, still red. Ok- Ethernet and power cables get swapped. Still red. Unplug it and let it sit overnight. Plug it in, still red.  Reached out to eufy support and they ask for order number, SN, issues all that. Two days go by and no answer - none of my exterior cameras work during this. Reach out - they ignore me so I follow up again. They ask for all the same info again.   They give me the spiel they’ve repeated to others on here, almost verbatim so it’s a generic rejection script.   ** However, I want to assure you that our primary goal is to develop products that our customers can enjoy for many years.

Upgraded from Arlo to Eufy S340. Night and day difference. ,7,1e45lmj,https://www.reddit.com/r/EufyCam/comments/1e45lmj/upgraded_from_arlo_to_eufy_s340_night_and_day/,"Hi people. So have started the CCTV kit with Arlo back in 2018. Super easy to use. Still have a few ultra 2 as backup to 247 PoE cameras (easier footage share).   Added a hand me down for a friend's place, Arlo Pro 2 last year (I swapped out when upgrading to Ultra 2). They didn't want wiring and was happy with something portable. They were more than happy to borrow the used Arlo Pro 2 and Arlo regular camera. Plugging in to charge was a fuff though for me. Bought an arlo solar. Turns out defective quickly. When searching solar options, S340 came up.   Was is curious how far ahead Eufy seemed to be. Added S340 last year (it ran with solar entirely since). Adding homebase was a good boost. Obviously we thought being able to compare in the same angle, it's hard to say which is better.   Haven't actually had the chance to do like for like replacement until this weekend. Swapped out the aging Arlo Pro 2 for a S340 in the same angle. The difference is frankly night and day. The zoom dual lens, solar built in and homehub integration, all without subscription. Was just so impressive. Yes I know vs Arlo Ultra 2 would been better comparison but has Arlo really progressed much in feature sets?  In my opinion Arlo was superlative back in this time its product has not been as innovative as much in the now crowded sector, and they seem to have been under pressure to monetise on subscription (Not a fan). In my opinion I don't expect Eufy to not go the subscription route too (as heavily) in time once it has market share. Obviously with Eufy there is the data concern, but the product itself is pretty impressive. I think I will be hard pushed to buy another Arlo at anywhere near the RRP having seen the Eufy. Inc solar the Eufy S340 on deal was around 2/3 the cost of a standalone Ultra 2 I've most recently ordered (no solar, needs subscription to optimise for usability).   Obviously having seen the PoE install, etc (zoom cameras, NVR, etc) - those are great for work/business settings or if you're very precise about needing those controls/features, etc. For less demanding settings, I got to say I was really impressed with the Eufy S340 and can't really see a way back to Arlo. The only thing I think could be improved with S340 is either a 2nd PIR sensor or some way to enable surveillance mode to tilt periodically (atm it's blind as a bat for wider area) that E340 has; also the 2mins recording cap is a bit short (given the large capacity battery). Generally very impressed coming from Arlo.  ",5,2024-07-15 20:41:22

Not a software person so please bear with me.   1. Eufy indoor solo cameras that have a SD slot store all video footage inside the camera itself, the footage is NOT sent to Eufy (unless subscribed to their Cloud service). Correct? 2. In order to receive event notifications and to watch live stream of the camera, the camera has to be connected to a home Wi-fi? I'm assuming that when I open the App and tap to play the live stream of the camera, the App is communicating directly with the camera and NOT through Eufy?  3. When I review events recorded in the App, the recording that I'm watching is downloaded from the camera (and not through Eufy) and played on my phone?  4. If all of the above essentially requires the camera be connected to the wi-fi, why do some threads in this sub said the cameras don't need to be connected to the internet? (is this the scenario when you set up your own network? I don't know how to do that so I guess Internet is my only option). In this case, what can I do to safeguard security (prevent hacking into the camera or gaining control of it?) 5. It doesn't seem to be necessary to give Eufy Security App location permission.

Continuous Recording Limit is now 5 Camera’s?,1,1e1whvu,https://www.reddit.com/r/EufyCam/comments/1e1whvu/continuous_recording_limit_is_now_5_cameras/,"I have a Homebase 3. I connected 2 Eufy wired outdoor (Eufy Outdoor C24) cameras to my homebase 3 as 24hr continuous recording. So they are both recording 24hrs. I then bought three indoor 2k cameras (Eufy C120) and connected them to the exact same homebase 3. Once I added them and got them up and running, I seen within the setting there was the ability to select 24 hours continuous recording, again, towards that same homebase 3. Also, none of those indoor cameras had SD cards in them. I just connected all three of them to the homebase 3 and selected 24 hours continuous recording. So now I have 3 indoor cameras and 2 outdoor cameras that are all recording continuously from the same single homebase 3.

And all the continuous footage was there & they are all currently continuously recording. So my question is that I thought the Eufy set limit was 4 cameras could only record continuously? However I have successfully gotten 5 cameras to continuously record? To be clear, I am not complaining, but did Eufy update this continuous recording limitation?

Homebase 3 + Camera Setup and Understanding of Recording/Saving,1,1dz6f9r,https://www.reddit.com/r/EufyCam/comments/1dz6f9r/homebase_3_camera_setup_and_understanding_of/,"Need help, would greatly appreciate links/screenshots/videos/etc of 'howto' setup properly to do the following:  Have the S380 Homebase 3, with a 4 TB SSD installed.  This is connected via ethernet to my router with  all cameras connecting via WiFi to said (mesh) router (type/model:  eero pro 6).  Each camera that supports a sd-micro card, has one ( probably not needed, but I did it and don't really care about the waste. )  Each camera has been 'connected' to the homebase (i.e. in the app -> camera -> settings, I see that each is successfully showing ""HomeBase Connection"".)   First question: When I was originally making this 'connection' between the cameras and homebase, I was asked whether or not I wanted to have either events or continuous recording.  I selected continuous recording.  I'm assuming that all video is being recorded to the HomeBase, is this correct?  I also see in the app -> camera -> setting -> video settings the option of 'continuous' recording being turned off, is this OK? i.e. this is referring to continuously record on the installed sd card?    With all of the above, I realize that I have a couple of months of recording time.  How to save everything?   I was thinking that I could plug into the back USB port an external hard drive, I have a number of WD 12 TB elements desktop external drives... One can use the 'Video Archive Function' within the app.  Are there limits to the number of days, or would I be able to archive 100 days - i.e. grab everything off the installed 4 TB drive?  Also, when doing this - does it grab everything or just events?  I would like to grab everything, not just events.    This last point is where I'm most confused about.  I see others have talked about having to hit 'record' on videos that were not tag'ed originally with an event by the system. This then creates an object that can then be archived? Or would the archive function grab everything, including 'dead' space ( i.e. video that has nothing/events-wise within)?  Or am I better served pulling the installed drive out from time to time, imaging it and then re-installing?  And if one were to go down that route, is there anything I ought to consider?  e.g. would the native file structure be something that is intuitive or is it 'weird'? ",3,2024-07-09 16:14:52

He needs a cellular option. I have had pretty good experiences with Eufy's Solar WifI cameras.   Here are my questions:  He will need three cellular cameras for proper coverage.   1. Does he have to purchase cellular options for each camera or can three cameras utilize just one cellular device?  2.  Does Eufy have a cellular home base so the cameras can connect to the home base and the home base connects only over cellular to the cloud?  3. Can the cellular camera  upload and store event data on the cloud so if in the event the cameras are stolen or disabled the event data is protected on the cloud.  Is there a fee for this option?,0,2024-07-06 13:02:11

I had to add detection zones on the s220 to minimise the detection of people walking past our home but s330 doesn't detect those same events with or without detection zones.  same story with the other 2 s330 cams that I have, 1 along the side of the home looking to the street and the other in my garden looking at my shed.  on s330's I have set surveillance to custom, allowing up to 2 mins of footage & motion detection all options ticked.  anyway to improve detection?  also battery life?

Any option to recover video if camera/homebase are stolen? ,3,1ds6fze,https://www.reddit.com/r/EufyCam/comments/1ds6fze/any_option_to_recover_video_if_camerahomebase_are/,"I know this has been a hot topic with Eufy for some time, but is there currently any option that allows you to recover videos if the cameras are removed/offline/reset?   People think it's rare, but I have a couple detective friends and they've been saying that now even smash and grab tweakers know to take or destroying any cameras, routers, hard drive looking things they see, etc. when they break in and it's more often than not they find the cameras and take/destroy them now.   That means it's getting increasingly likely that your cameras will be stolen/disabled, and possibly your homebase, since most are probably connecting them by network cable to their routers and are usually not well hidden.     So if they break in and take/destroy your cameras it seems you are out of luck trying to get any video evidence with Eufy.  This would seem to be a massive security risk. It would be nice if there was an option to auto-download events to say your phone or externally.   So just to make sure I understand this right......  1) if you have cameras and a HB3, and someone steals the camera can you still get the videos off the HB3?   2) If someone takes the cameras and the HB3, assume there's no way to get videos?   There's no option to store clips etc. on your phone/cloud automatically?  3) Is the same true if you pay for the cloud storage? I've heard that the cloud storage has reduced resolution clips/video so that's a big downside, but if cameras are offline/destroyed can you at least still get to the video in the cloud?

Wife has been hounding me about selecting a doorbell for our daughter’s soon to be college dorm. Wife and the mom of roommate got together and decided to get them a camera doorbell for security.

Also local storage is a must since I’d like to keep footage in case we need to retrieve it later. It doesn’t need to be much but enough time to pull it if there’s an emergency. I’m thinking about the E340 and S380. So I’m looking for feedback.

Eufy Wireless 2K Doorbell: Is the Dual Camera version worth $80 (25%) extra?,1,1djyaal,https://www.reddit.com/r/EufyCam/comments/1djyaal/eufy_wireless_2k_doorbell_is_the_dual_camera/,"First time smart doorbell purchaser based in Aus. Was about to hit buy on a Eufy Wireless/Battery 2K with HomeBase 2 but now hesitating whether to spend AU$80 (25%) extra on the version with two cameras. The single cam is $319 here (quite steep).  I understand the benefits of dual cam are:  - Ongoing vision of packages: We get a decent no of packages but have never had anything stolen, assuming the single cam will work fine for telling us the package is delivered when the person walks up?  - Possibly more accurate detection technology: ls this true in practice?   - “Delivery Guard” technology - Is this actually practically useful?  Are there any other valuable benefits on top of the single cam (which still seems to offer two way audio etc)?  Opinions most welcome!!!",3,2024-06-20 00:14:58

I had some issues with the 2k doorbell and motion detecting having lag or no response.  I tried the usual, lowered the video quality, expanded motion zones, and did the whole reset and everything.  One thing I didn't see mention was to edit the custom recording and when to trigger an alert. It defaults to 60 seconds and had a trigger alert every 15 seconds.  I changed the trigger alert to 2 or 5 seconds and voila now it picks up every motion. Before it would send an alert, wait record 60 seconds, and then wait 15 seconds to trigger the next alert.   It went from being able to stand in front of the camera and dance like the old man in the Six flags commercials and not recognize the motion to not being able to wave at it without instant notification.  I'll also note you may get the alert but there still might be a delay with the video if your connection is weak as it sends the video to the base, and then out to your app so makes sense. I lowered the quality on processing the video and that helped, but if your connection is good enough shouldn't be a problem.

Can the s350 record to both HB3 and the cloud at the same time?   I know the cloud busts the video down in resolution. 3. Even further down the rabbit hole, there's ton's of contradictory info on this, some say it's fixed, other's say it's not.  If the camera is stolen, can the videos/recordings, not just events, but also continuous 24/7 recordings be accessed without the camera form either the HB3 or Cloud?   There's no point in securing the data if all they have to do is take the cameras to ensure you can't see it later anyway.  I suppose if the HB3 is well hidden it's not a huge issue, unless of course if you can't get the events AND continuous recordings without the camera.

I think with any product like this you need to be concerned with product variations caused by basic component availability.  Based on previous experiences one product could last five years and another could last 13 months and there is no way to determine the life expectancy of your particular product.  The only thing you know for sure is that there is a one year warranty.  I have purchased a number of their low end indoor cameras and one outdoor solar powered camera and I love them.  That said I have spent time with their tech support people to see if they offer an extended warranty, they do not.  I wanted to buy a complete home system from Eufy that would run between $500 and $1000, but with only a one year warranty and no option for replaceable batteries I just don't think their larger systems are cost effective.   If you are lucky and get 5+ years out of your purchase that's a great deal, but if it only lasts twenty months you will lose a lot of money.

Copying off all clips from a P24 camera. Any way to detect incomplete clips barring just making another full pass and comparing file sizes?,1,1db6ikp,https://www.reddit.com/r/EufyCam/comments/1db6ikp/copying_off_all_clips_from_a_p24_camera_any_way/,"I've got over 20,000 clips saved now from 3 cameras and I *thought* I was done with this but I had the thought to check the smallest file sizes to make sure there weren't any weird corruption/incomplete file issues.  I found some, all of them play, nothing looks corrupt but some of them are shorter than they should be and here's the extra weird bit, the end of the clip is there but not the beginning so say I'm supposed to have a 30 second clip I may only have the last 7 seconds of it implying the downloading/conversion process works backwards.  So I'm sure I have 30 second clips that should actually be 2 minutes and no obvious way to tell.  Also downloading the same file twice only results in a bitwise match ~72% of the time even though the videos are visually identical which makes confirming i've got a good copy of the file quite difficult as it can ""not match"" and still be fine.  Also for anyone wondering that 20,000+ clips ends up being 6.8 hours of video and about 121GB. However that's the total from 3 cameras.  From a single P24 with a 128GB card I was able to pull 6.3 hours of video in 18,919 clips which totaled 113GB of 2K video.  The reason for the large difference in that camera vs the other two is that particular camera was only configured to record on motion so it had several times more clips than the others that were doing continuous recording.  I plan on making another post explaining how I did this at some later point.  I'm hoping to get most of the bugs worked out of the process or at the very least identified before trying to explain to anyone else how to do it.  Assuming there isn't any more straight forward way to do it, it looks like the next task is finding a way to batch compare while ignoring differences of less than 1kB by filesize only as it keeps doing weird things with the file contents that still leave visually identical videos.  I don't think there are a lot and it'd be faster to just go in and re-download the few incomplete but I can't think of any way to batch identify which ones those are.  On an individual basis I can just compare the length shown in the app to the length of the file I have but I don't think I can scale that.",2,2024-06-08 16:16:33

I just purchased 2 S340s (no home base) for outside security on the recommendation of my neighbor instead of going with more Ring devices.   I'm having a lot of issues with Alexa integration,  and am hoping I am just doing something wrong. I've scoured this reddit,  the eufy forums and Google but suggestions aren't working.   In the app, cameras are fine and quick to respond. However, trying to pull them up in the Alexa app is a 1 out of 8 success rate. As you can see in the screenshot,  I can't get snapshots like on my Ring doorbell and stick up cam (the eufy cams are backyard and garage). I was hoping to have 4 nice snapshots when I opened the Alexa app. The cameras (when they do connect to Alexa) are also tediously slow to load.   I see integration between the two is a known problem from my searching. Any solutions other than the following which I tried:  1. Disabling/Enabling Eufy Security Alexa skill 2. Removing cameras from Alexa then rediscovering  3. Rebooting both cameras 4. Disconnecting then reconnecting cams to wifi  Any suggestions? I like to have everything centralized so this may be a deal breaker for me. The cameras were advertised to ""Work With Alexa"", which they technically do,  but awfully.   I hope there's something I can do because they seem to be really quality devices. ",14,2024-06-06 03:50:56

Eufycam S40/S230 fixed.,1,1d8qzr6,https://www.reddit.com/r/EufyCam/comments/1d8qzr6/eufycam_s40s230_fixed/,"Hi everyone, this is my first post on Reddit , I'm hoping it might help someone.  I purchase my Eufy S40 or S230 ( same one I think) 13 months ago. Its mounted under my eaves so gets good protection from the rain but still gets 2 hours of sunshine even in Winter. It worked perfectly until last week. I checked the app to see if had recorded anything through the night but it was switched off,  I also got the message  (can't connect to camera). It was definitely on last night, and that's the first time I've seen this message. The on/off switch was greyed out on the app now so I couldn't do anything,  it was dead, oh, it had at least 97% battery, it's usually 99% daily. I took it down and took it inside, got out the instructions booklet, and looked online for answers because the warranty had expired 2 weeks earlier. I opened the little rubber flap on the back and pressed the sync button,  it said press for 2 seconds,  you'll get a Blue light and a beep. I got the Blue light but no beep, app still showed can't connect. I pressed it again , no beep I tried and tried, it wasn't beeping. It said press and hold for 10 seconds, it'll beep, this enables a master reset. Still nothing. It says charge it for 10 minutes then try again,  I did but still nothing. I uninstalled the app and re-installed it but it wouldn't respond to scanning the QR code, apart from the Blue light it was dead. I put it back outside on my house because it would act as a deterrent and I ordered the same model again. Two days later I decided to reposition the camera a little further under the eaves to give it even more protection and it would still get ample sunshine, then when my new one arrives I can do a straight switch over. I took it down and took it indoors, I opened the rear flap just being inquisitive and pressed the sync button,,,,,OMG it beeped after 1 second, I pressed it again, it beeped again. I put my phone camera on the QR code,  it worked, sent me a QR code, I scanned it with the front of the S40 and it worked, everything  worked like it had just come out of the box for the first time. I'm still baffled what actually happened. When it booted up again it said 99+ clips had been recorded over the last two days and the battery was down at 35%. We do get a fair bit of fog on the East coast so not sure if the moisture had somehow got into it,  I'm really baffled. New one not arrived yet but I'll keep it in case this one develops a fault again. If yours packs up give it a couple of days, it might start up again. Steve.",0,2024-06-05 14:14:45

This is my first post in the EufyCam section. My cousin just called me and wants to hire me to install 8 cameras on his new ""Twice The Ice"" machine in Bernalillo NM. It is a very small building and he wants coverage around the entire thing. It did not come with any security or internet as of yet, but is wired with a  landline of course. He has the options to use CenturyLink internet or Tmobile Home or Verizon Home Internet for the monitoring. He is also interested in either the S330's or S340's and they must be a wireless system. So, I have never installed a security camera system before but I am a Tech nerd and this kind of work is right up my alley. I do all the tech work at his house, computers, networking, entertainment systems, etc etc, which is why he wants me to do this. I'm also his part time Ice Machine mechanic.  **Since I'm new to security cam installations, here are my list of questions.**  1. Eight S330's or S340's? Or something else? Is eight cams overkill? 2. Landline internet or Cell service? 3. What wifi version needs to be used? The Ice machine is a metal tin building, but small. 4. Is the HomeBase required? Why? 5. Should I get a really good router (strong wifi) or an average cheap router? Or use the ISP provided units such as what comes with Tmobile or Verizon? 6. Does the solar panel need direct sunlight? Can the solar panel be installed above a fabric type awning for direct solar (small home in awning perhaps?), and the cam directly below the awning?   **Requirements:**  1. Must be solar panel type. 2. Must be wireless, no through holes on the building. 3. Must be reliable with local video storage. 4. Must be able to monitor via his smart phone.  He is going with Eufy on my recommendation, since that is what I have selected to use on my home soon. Any tips or recommendations are welcome please. Thank You!

It initiated update through the app, but for days it never showed that it completed the update. Just didn't respond anymore.  Contacted Eufy, they said to try removing it from the app and reinstalling. But – once uninstalled, it never was able to reconnect to the same 2.4 router. Tried the normal sync-beep-generate-QR-code-on-phone method through the app, got the ""failed to connect"" error. Did it the other way by scanning the QR code on the back of the camera after getting the ""didn't hear a beep?"" error. No joy.  Went to the router end of things. Disabled all firewalls, made sure ports were open. Nothing. Rebooted router, even started a separate wifi network with a new name. Nope. Downloaded Eufy app on a non-connected different iPhone and tried to connect it there. Same errors.  Contacted Eufy again, they said to reset the camera by clicking the button a mess of times, holding it 10 seconds, etc. Kept trying and trying. Nothing worked.  I got another (different model) Eufy camera this weekend, and it connected just fine, so it's not the router or connection.

It then asks me to hold the SYNC button for 2s until it beeps.  I do that and hit next on the app, which causes the HB2 to start chirping.  The doorbell doesn't react even though it is connected via USB and is literally touching the HB2.  After a while I get a message on the app to say ""Unable to add Battery Doorbell"".  Unhelpfully it asks me to check if the HB is connected to the internet, and restart HB before retrying to add the camera.  The HomeBase is definitely connected as it has the blue light on.  I've tried all combinations of having the HB on the ethernet connection, or the wifi with the same result.  Have also tried restarting and resetting.  I have seen a thread recommending to reset the doorbell.  I have tried both pressing the SYNC button 5 times and holding it down for around 10 seconds, which both resulted in beeps.  Neither resolved the connection issue. Finally, I tried to connect the doorbell as the first device after the HB, and only after I had first connected the two cameras.  Nothing!

Is there a camera similar to the Solocam C210 with ability to use an SD card?,1,1cymauf,https://www.reddit.com/r/EufyCam/comments/1cymauf/is_there_a_camera_similar_to_the_solocam_c210/,"I'm a fan of Eufy cameras, I have a few E220 and C120 indoor wired cameras that have been working well as security cameras. I just got my first outdoor battery powered model, the Solocam C210, and I'm pretty impressed by it. The only issue I have with it is that it doesn't have an SD card. Does Eufy make an outdoor battery powered camera with a micro SD card slot?  I'd love to use this as a trail camera, filming animals in the woods at night, but there isn't wifi. My first impression is that this camera works really well for that, but the 8 gigs of onboard storage isn't quite enough.     ",7,2024-05-23 06:36:33

The doorbell is wired to trickle charge the battery.  Just moving from Ring I wanted to try cameras to see the difference.  Not once since I've had it setup have I been able to see the motion that triggered my notification.  Everytime I check the person is already gone and all I see is a package that has been delivered.  This is in both wifi and data.   I checked my speed for upload and download and at my work and on data 5GUW my download was 534Mbps and upload was 81Mbps. At home on my wifi it was higher.   When I click on my notification the app takes a sec to load, then when you press the play button that's another 5-6 seconds before it loads, so probably about 8-10 seconds for everything once I get the notification   I never had this issue with my Ring pro doorbell, and I know that eufy don't has the pre-roll  In my settings I had the detection sensitivity set to 5, & human only. Then I set the detection sensitivity to advanced and set everything to 20ft. In the activity zone I have the front view & porch view set to a much greater distance than I had my Ring pro.  Under notification I have it set to ""most efficiency""    I thought about moving the ""detection type"" to all motion but the way I have the activity zone set up it goes far into the driveway and it'll pick up our vehicles when coming or going.

So far we've been very happy (it even has crying detection).  The one thing we can't figure out is how to mount it using a flexible clamp. The C120 comes with a wall mount but we live in a 1 bedroom apartment and move the crib around periodically. I could drill it into the crib itself, but the crib is pretty expensive (and also not that sturdy—think it is plywood).

Snoozing notifications dont work?,1,1cvryyv,https://www.reddit.com/r/EufyCam/comments/1cvryyv/snoozing_notifications_dont_work/,"Hi,     i have a Doorbell T8213 with [0.1.9.2](http://0.1.9.2) Version, connected with HomeBase2 with Version 3.3.3.4h.  I have a problem: when someone stands in front of my door for a longer period while chatting, my phone and the home base keep going off. Normally, you can just go into the app and activate the ""snooze"" option for 30 minutes. However, the alarm continues at least on the home base, which keeps notifying me that there are people at the door. This is extremely annoying. How can I stop this?",0,2024-05-19 16:17:34
No motion detection & recording since HB3 firmware update on 5/11,3,1cvrmpg,https://i.redd.it/bnss7bx6pe1d1.png,"The HB3 got a firmware update on 5/11 and since then, none of my cameras connected to it are recording whent therw is motion detection, let alone sending notifications. All standalone cameras connected to WiFi work just fine but everything connected to HB3 do not send any notifications nor do they record when there is motion. Nothing has changed in the setting and they are properly set as they have always been before that update.  Before the update, I use to have the no motion recording and notifications issue before but rebooting the HB3 regularly would fix it temporarily but now the reboot does not help at all since 5/11. It is quite comical that the update notes would advertise 'inprove the base station notification feature"" bit instead has completely broke it.   This is has been and is still eally frustrating. I have purchased several cameras over the years from Eufy and today none of them are providing the very basic functionality they were advertised for with regards to motion detection, notification and recording. Seriously, Eufy. What is going on?",12,2024-05-19 16:02:57
Motion detection quality issues?,1,1cvpj7r,https://www.reddit.com/r/EufyCam/comments/1cvpj7r/motion_detection_quality_issues/,I have a cat and I like to keep a tag of when he enters the house and when he exits. Sometimes it works and sometimes the motion detection does not capture.   The sensitivity of the motion detection is set to 7 (highest). And I have a s40 solar cam.   Does anyone else face this issue? ,0,2024-05-19 14:29:06
Need advice on cameras,1,1cvphuo,https://www.reddit.com/r/EufyCam/comments/1cvphuo/need_advice_on_cameras/,"Hello, I am looking to buy a doorbell camera and a camera for my yard.  I am looking at S120 (or S230 or similar) and C120.  What I want: 1. Wireless doorbell 2. Wireless camera with solar panel, ideally with built in light 3. Some type of storage which I can access on my phone, so not just live feed 4. I don't mind subscription as long as it is not too expensive (under 100 gbp/yearly)  5. Decent notification speed and WiFi stability  I am open to any other brand as well-Ring, Blink, or other or even combination  My questions for above mentioned models are: Can I access local storage with recordings from the app on my phone?  Is there a limit on video recording lenght?   Thank you  ",3,2024-05-19 14:27:09
