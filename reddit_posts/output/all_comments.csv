1f2cbpu,lka19yn,,TeeVeeWatcher,Maybe it was a dud device. I just got this and the install was simpler than the doorbell.,1,1724811330.0
1f2bps1,lk56e7o,,R8_M3_SXC,"Edit: when selecting the notification, it doesn’t show me footage of the event, rather it goes to a live view of the camera. This is worse. Anyone know what i can do to resolve?  I don’t have any Eufy subscription so I expect the videos to be stored locally on the cameras storage. Could it be that the storage is full on these cameras?",1,1724746310.0
1f2bps1,lk5u4jd,lk56e7o,hrking2k2,I think there is an option in settings for what happens when you tap the notification - either go to event or live view. Maybe yours is set to the latter.,1,1724759967.0
1f2bps1,lk6wc1q,lk5u4jd,R8_M3_SXC,"Hey, its set to show the event. The issue was that the storage on the camera was full so it couldn’t record any new footage. Having wiped existing footage, i now see new events.",1,1724773640.0

1f26qf0,lk5ok35,,senaiboy,"I bought the E340, currently using it on battery only as we didn't need the 24/7 recording.  From what I remember the manual says it can be used either on battery or hardwired. Hardwired is basically just constantly charging the battery.  https://www.reddit.com/r/eufy/s/aHAqOkbN39  Discussion on S330 Vs E340 posted by another user in the thread above:  I recently tried both. Here's my finding. Note:  The S model is the top of the line with all the bells and whistles. The E model is the more economy line and cheaper price. It goes S then E then C. Mercedes naming scheme?   1. E340 has new optics because it's newer, the result is a bit better night picture. Removable battery and can stand alone. The S330 can do color at night if you have enough lighting,  like a porch light.  2. E340 lost the radar sensor, and with it, a whole suite of advanced detections and capabilities the S330 has in the app.  3. Physically the E340 is cheaply made. Doesn't feel solid in the hand. The bottom camera is not adjustable either, the S330 does.   Everything else is the same because most of it is in the software and the Homebase.   Last but not least, both work with the original house chime. Homebase, Eufy Chime, and Alexa.",2,1724757345.0

My lock would drain it's batteries (8xAA) in just under 2 weeks when it should last months.  I redid the network connection, and now things are the way they should be.  For the doorbell, make sure the firmware is up to date, make sure it detects you're wired to power (I think there's a wizard when you turn on prerecording).  I also find, using the guest network if your router supports it is a great way to cheaply 'secure' your IOT devices, and segregate the traffic a bit on your router.",2,1724723105.0

At this point your Homebase should be wireless and connected to wi-fi. Now go into the app and check if your settings for ""continuous recording"" are still chosen.

That being said I did get it re-enabled for now using VegasRealty’s suggestion in this thread. Plugging Ethernet in temporarily allowed me to switch it back and then the setting remained when I switched back to wifi.  You just have to be sure not to change it because it won’t let you switch it back, although I imagine they will eventually patch out this loophole.",1,1724690078.0

1f13b5f,ljyyatr,ljweqzi,wongl888,I don’t think it is a bug judging from the warning/error messages I received every time I unplug the Ethernet connection on my HB3 (and it reverting to WiFi connection).   Suffice to say that Eufy must have received a number of customer complaints regarding continuous recording using WiFi and hence putting a stop to it.

1f13b5f,lk19v3l,ljyyatr,Moonlord_,Yeah doesn’t seem like a bug…the warnings saying that you can’t store continuous recordings when on wifi were obviously intentionally written and placed there.  Also Eufy support echoed it and mentioned that it needs to be on Ethernet as well.   I just can’t understand why.   The cameras still send/store their video to the Homebase wirelessly regardless of how the Homebase is connected.  It doesn’t use the Homebase’s connection to the router to store video. What does the Homebase being on Ethernet or wifi have to do with anything?  That only comes into play when you’re trying to view footage from the Homebase and that’s the same for every camera.,2,1724689853.0

1ez7wp6,ljiqjwb,,ntsefamyaj,"Contact support for an explanation (doubt they'll give you an honest answer, though). It happens from time to time for the me. In the recent past, I presumed it was faulty memory, so I replaced all my SD card cameras with the max size 128 GB high endurance cards (no idea why Eufy won't support larger sizes like 256-512 GB). The error messaging incidence has dropped dramatically since, but it hasn't completely stopped. Overall, you can ignore the occasional message. However, frequent errors suggest the memory card is probably bad.  In addition, Eufy storage logic is just terrible. They randomly throw errors sometimes, even for new SD cards.   Please be aware that flash memory technology has a limit on how many read/writes can be made to a specific memory cell. This is especially noticeable with security cameras and dashcams featuring continuous recording. High endurance flash memory designs AND larger capacities help to reduce the occurrence by spreading read/write activities more evenly across more cells. Some SD card designs in particular have more efficient distribution than others, thereby reducing failure rates. This is reflected in the price. I've had good luck with Samsung, Sandisk, and Kingston high endurance cards across 10x Eufy and 4x other branded security cameras, in addition to 2x dashcams.",1,1724405981.0
1ez7wp6,ljjh6tk,ljiqjwb,halflistening,"Not op, but I had made a post asking about sd cards as well, so hope you don't mind me nosing in since you seem to have some knowledge and experience. Am I right in reading your comment to mean that you can't use a higher capacity SD card than what the camera lists as the max storage? Cause that sucks haha. I'm deciding between the E340 and S330 floodlight cams. The E340 says up to 128 gb sd storage and I was thinking I could use a 256 or 512 endurance card to mitigate some of memory rewrite risk from the continuous recording. The S330 is only event recordings so only 8 gb but not expandable so presumably I can't replace the card if it starts to go. I'm almost considering just grabbing a home base as well to cut out any worry. Just curious what your preference or experience has been with the different recording options.",1,1724418702.0
1ez7wp6,ljk6im4,ljjh6tk,ntsefamyaj,"You won't be able to use a higher capacity card, unfortunately. And the built in memory can't be replaced. The SD 128 GB high endurance option is your best bet. Stick to name brand with reliable reputation. I've actually had warranty replacements through Samsung and Sandisk before (some vendors tout lifetime warranty). Very easy RMA process. Fortunately, I haven't had many failures with the high endurance cards. Plenty with the normal cards, though.  As for Homebase 3, that's an option as well if supported by your specific camera model. I have Homebase 3 also, but only for my outdoor, fixed memory Eufycam models and two Solocam models. I feel putting all my cameras into a single point of failure is a bit risky. Plus, performance takes a huge hit. I have over 20 cameras total, plus sensors, etc. and so I've lost count. But Homebase 3 struggles. 😂",1,1724427126.0

1eyn9rz,ljfeu8s,ljfav3p,ntsefamyaj,"Imagine a resizable box that tracks around a moving person or object. That box gets bigger or smaller depending on the sensitivity setting. Overall, the box is bigger than the actual thing and will touch the activity zone to trigger recording.  Also,  * The PIR (passive infrared sensor) only triggers a check and uses infrared/heat. It doesn't do anything with the activity zone. * The camera does an optical analysis to determine if the motion was a person, pet, or whatever. It does a look back at the past and present few seconds of footage. If the motion is deemed to fit your criteria, it gets saved, a thumbnail is created (and uploaded to the cloud), and push alerts are sent to your app.  * I'm unclear how exactly this gets processed, but I suspect some of it is done in the cloud. I've tested this previously by completely killing internet to my Eufy devices on the firewall and motion activated recordings do stop after awhile. Eufy won't answer me on this. * Related to number 2, sometimes events aren't deemed to fit your criteria, but a thumbnail gets generated anyway. There are no video recordings saved, BUT you'll see the thumbnail in the app. This is how I figured out the camera does a look back and simply doesn't save the footage.",3,1724354784.0

Cameras that can use a micro SD as storage can only use cards up to 128GB, I bought a 512GB card for nothing, I hope I can save someone from the same mistake.

Then log back in to your account. If that doesn't work, Uninstalling and Reinstalling the App should also work. If that doesn't work, Uninstall > Restart Phone > Reinstall > Launch > Log in to your account.  If it's iOS, if they don't have a similar option to just reset/clear all data and log back in, uninstall and reinstall the App.  There are some things set like optimization of the battery, don't reset my settings, etc., that doing a Clear Data will help keep you from having to redo. You'll still have to possibly reset any custom notification sounds, depending on how you customized them. Fair warning. Uninstall/Reinstall is always an option, but you may need to redo some things that were setup before.  If you uninstall and reinstall, you'll likely have to go through and set back up all of the things like optimization again. Something to be aware of.  The more I have to deal with the little errors and crap from this ecosystem, new products that don't integrate (at all or properly), the more I am going to replace them with hardwired NVR with PoE cameras and not have to deal with batteries and all this.

1evc6ml,liqk89t,,AirFlavoredLemon,"It sounds like you troubleshot a lot of things... really well covered. First thing I would check is Firmware version \*and\* hardware version. As far as I know, there's only one version (no revisions) of the outdoor cam - but if there is one - you should see it reflect in the model number in the app. Should start with a T. Maybe the newer cameras in your main home have a different wifi radio that doesn't like coexisting with your APs (both the Eero and and your temporary test WAP).  But realistically, I'm with your conclusions:  Doesn't seem like WiFi (App -> Camera = Good)  I would say your next test, if you could magically teleport them; is to swap a camera from the vacation home to the main home. I did get a batch of 3 bad eufy outdoor cams with stuck IR sensors - so there's a potential your batch at your home has some.... hardware issue that only occurs when paired via RTSP /s ...   The most I can contribute for personal experience is... I do have an issue with \*only\* my spherical outdoor cams connecting and recording 24/7 to Homebase 3. This was an after-thought add-on feature for the outdoor cams.   I'm using model T8442 (the 1080p and 2k models). I either drop recordings entirely (and the HB3 only shows me events) or it records 24/7 at a very choppy 2FPS (so its not bandwidth limited - its extremely choppy, from 0 FPS to bursts of 5fps, back to 0, etc). I'm pretty sure eufy uses RTSP internally to connect to the Outdoor cam - as a way to grandfather cameras that were releases prior to HB3. RTSP option gets disabled when connected to HB3.  None of my other eufy cameras (indoor 2k / indoor 2k pan and tilt - both grandfathered cameras) have an issue connecting to my HB3 (presumably through RSTP). All four of my outdoor cams do. I've done the same - attempted two different WAPs, both on different channels (6 and 11, 20Mhz width). And they're placed within 1ft of an indoor camera - and they just don't record 24/7.   I've reverted to just letting them record events-only (even though the app clearly has 24/7 enabled). Event playback through my HB3 is buttery smooth - as if I'm viewing the camera live from the app. It seems like a firmware issue maybe? Or maybe the camera identifies the event and records it locally before uploading it to the HB3. (I don't know how RTSP works - or HB3).   Can you try another app or device to access the camera via RTSP? Maybe rule out SecuritySpy?",1,1723998725.0

I have the plus plan set up with my Eufy alarm system and safe and that’s it. The cameras aren’t unfortunately as accurate when it comes to its motion and identification abilities. There for you might get false alarms for random motion. If you want to go that route I’d set up the camera alarm to trigger thus you getting an alarm notification on your phone and then manually contact the monitoring center from the shield icon in the app. I’m not 100% sure but the monitoring center (Noonlight) doesn’t have access to the camera feeds thus they would simply be getting data that your camera was triggered and then they’d still contact you to verify what’s going on before dispatching police.

And these cameras are not cheap either...   I live in a very sunny location and the 1 year battery life claim is total rubbish.   I can have a tree nearby drain the battery 40% in one night as the camera wakes up and checks if it's worth recording then goes back to sleep. It keeps doing this and draining the battery. The solar panel (internal or external) doesn't charge fast enough either.  I purchased the Homebase 3 with 4x S330 cameras in a pack.  I have learnt this - battery / solar cameras are a waste of time and money.  For usuable footage you need 24/7 recording cameras that are powered. These S330's miss events if its outside of its PIR (i.e sensor light style detection) zone so they can't be relied upon. It's happened several times to me so far.  I have moved my system to E330 Pros - the cams that are mains powered with 24/7 recording so footage is never missed. Far better but you need power run.   My S330's have been moved to gates and other low traffic areas. Anything with high frequency causes the batteries to run down fast.  One of my S330 has flaked off to a smooth solar panel finish. It doesn't want to charge more than 50% for some reason.,2,1723798173.0

We are on the second summer now so we are getting a pattern on how they charge up across the year.

It is also Apple homekit compatible and can record to the cloud if you have over 2tb icloud membership. But there is a situation if you are going to use it with Apple homekit. If you are going to use non-homekit, homebase supports 16-20 cameras, but if you are going to use it with homekit, one homebase supports 4 homekit cameras. So for example, if you are going to use 8 cameras, you need to buy 2 homebases. Or if you are going to use 9 cameras, you need to buy 3 homebases. I think this is a problem that can be solved with software, but I think anker has restricted it to sell more products. There is no problem on the Apple side, the problem stems from the anker brand.   I didn’t use the door lock or the doorbell, but the room is also homekit compatible and if you have a package over 2tb, there is also a transaction log to the cloud in icloud.

Problem with Eufy is, they release a firmware update that fixes one issue, but breaks something that was never an issue.  Another problem is the long wait on their ""Compatibility list"". Legend has it that it pre-dates Jesus. Seriously, it's been nearly 2 years and some of the cameras that were meant to be compatible out of the box is now in ""evaluation"" stage. 2 years!  I honestly feel that Eufy released half baked items and now just slowly releasing updates to have it rectified.  My S330 floodlight cam worked flawlessly when it was on 1.0, now on 1.1.1.7, it spasms out when an object walks to close towards the camera and pans out down the street.  My S330 Smartlock use to have HDR toggle, now gone and the morning sun just glares out the image. Also lens distortion is now removed.  2 years in, S330 Floodlight still not compatible with HB3, even though the hardware allows it to be.  E110 Garage cam, again, almost 2 years in and still no compatibility, ""under evaluation"" even though advertised as ready out of the box.

Way better image quality, tracking, and 5GHz wifi support is fantastic (especially in a congested area like an apt).  However, I would consider thinking about doing two or three of the older 2k pan and titls.

I have all of mine except 1 (set above an entrance door) to single camera only, wide angle. The camera only records in 4k if you choose one of the two cameras. Otherwise, you can set it to save a single video file with both camera streams in one view; at 2k.

I have only used the 24/7 recording option since I got my first wired Eufy cam back in 2020. The person detection AI does often pickup stuff it should (about >90% of the time) but not always which is why I use 24/7 recording. Also, I like to be able to go back a while before an event and after. If you use 24/7 recording on a wired Eufy cam it will mark the continuous recording parts without an event as blue in the timeline, for an event it will mark them as orange in the timeline. You can zoom in and out of the timeline to see more specific times (minutes instead of hours) or zoom out to see less specific times (hours instead of minutes) seeking options. There are also left and right arrows that make it super easy to jump to the very beginning of an event (orange) in the timeline.

1eocd3u,lhu8r93,lhtlfth,-JEFF007-,"1. What do you mean by operate at the same time? 2. Yes, you can have your wired cams recording 24/7. I do not have any wireless models but I believe that they can capture just the events while the wired ones are capturing 24/7. I put a microSD card in each of my Eufy wired cams and this seems to work just fine. I am not interested in maintaining a costly centralized DVR type of system. Eufy does sell the Homebase 3 which can act like a centralized DVR system but they are on their third version of it and I am not sure how reliable it really could be as all your 24/7 recording wired cams would be constantly hitting it wirelessly all the time if 24/7 recording is an option on it, LOL.   Another note, I came from Wyze and the one feature I miss is the ability to be able to view all of the cameras live feeds at once. This is NOT an option with the Eufy wired cams and I believe that is also true for the wireless ones within the native Eufy app.  I have been waiting years for Eufy to fix this with the wired cams as I get why they do not want it available for the wireless/battery operated ones as that would drain the battery too quickly but it would work on the wired cams in theory. My guess is their bandwidth costs would sky rocket but I am not sure what the real reason is. Most people expect this feature to be available today on just about any cam system. If you are wanting to look at something such as the live feed of a business with many cams at once then Eufy might not be the best…my opinion.  Eufy wired cams seem to work fine without a subscription which keeps me using them. They are not crippled or less functional because of this. The AI is onboard (the camera itself) which means the cloud is not working or taking a long time to decide what is a person and what is not. This is also known as Edge onboard AI. So notifications 99% of the time come thru reliably and very quickly. This is not usually the case with costly cloud dependent AI cams from other companies.",1,1723511182.0
1eocd3u,lhudiha,lhu8r93,NattiousMattious,"Sorry if I didn’t explain it well enough, but you pretty much covered it in point number 2.   Basically I bought a kit a couple weeks ago for my new house. Haven’t set anything up and played around with it yet, hence all the questions!  The kit included 2 basic outdoor wireless cams, 1 outdoor wireless cam that can rotate 360 degrees and the Homebase3. The two main reasons I went with Eufy is 1. No subscription needed….and 2. I was under the impression they could record 24/7.   But now that I’ve found out that only the wired cams can record 24/7…..I am wondering if I could have my wireless cams record motion activated events….and my wired cams record 24/7….with everything being stored on the homebase3 with a 1TB hard drive installed. Then have everything controlled remotely by the Eufy app.  If that isn’t possible, I may have to have the wireless cams record motion activated events to the homebase3……and then the wired cams record 24/7 to their onboard SD card.",1,1723512976.0
1eocd3u,lhv7bjj,lhudiha,-JEFF007-,"Another caveat if you record 24/7 is that they do not disclose until you are in the settings to turn it on is that all 24/7 recording is done in 1080p, not 2K if you have one of those models that supports 2K. There are other Reddit complaints about this that are years old. I think the user should be able to decide if their SD card fills up more frequently with 2K instead of 1080p, not Eufy or buy a bigger SD card.  It will be interesting to know if Homebase 3 will support 24/7 recording on the wired cams. I am assuming it does not but could be wrong. My theory is that the Homebase 3 works on events only and that is where the advanced AI comes into play with the facial recognition stuff. Scanning the events for such info.",1,1723526179.0

1eocd3u,lhv5lok,lhv2fs4,-JEFF007-,"Good question. It was a guess as I stated. If the app does communicate with a server every time you open it, I am assuming the cameras do too but I do not know to what extent. So instead of connecting to only one cam at a time, all users suddenly connecting to all of their cams in one session at one time would consume more bandwidth.

One is set for ""Colour"", where 24 hour recordings are in B&W (IR), but the light comes on and switches to colour when an event is detected. After an incident I realised that it is good to know the colour of vehicles, but the problem has been that passing vehicles were detected late, so they are out of frame by the time colour kicks in. So I set the other to ""Turn off mode"" so it is permanently in colour with no IR.  Must have been a software update: since the loss of colour and then restoration the vehicle detection on the ""Colour"" camera seems to occur much earlier, so the spotlight comes on earlier and switches to colour quicker so you can see the vehicle in colour before it disappears.",1,1723818675.0

I know from measurement that the doorbell draws around 175 ma when its awake and transmitting.  I haven't measured the sleeping current, but it probably is only 10-20% of the awake current.

1emft92,lgzzutq,,electro-zx,"This is normal.  I have two pan & tilt cams that wake up on a set schedule and turn the IR LEDs on and off and spin around.  Happens at exactly 4:29 AM, usually on Wednesdays.  Sometimes the day of the week changes, but the time is always the same.  I checked network traffic at that time and did see a few small bits of traffic back to Eufy's AWS servers, but nothing large enough to be video.  I assume that its checking for firmware updates and also that the camera is active.    This same behavior happens for these cams and a couple of Eufys battery cams, whether they are turned on or off.  Only way to stop this is to cut power to the powered cams.  You could use a smart plug to accomplish this if it bothers you.  The reason I caught it initally is I added an indoor camera in the garage to cover my workshop area and turned on night vision.  I had motion detection on low, but every Wednesday at 4:29 AM it picked up my pan & tilt camera actvity.  Put another spare cam on my other pan& tilt and it had the same behavior a few minutes after the first cam.  I have since seen the 2C and 2 Pro battery cams flip their LEDS on and off on a similar schedule, although the time and day of the week was different.

I don’t use Alexa, I have Google home setup and the E340 does not currently integrate with it like I had with my Nest Hello. I am in the same boat as the last poster using the HB3 for chime, but I do also have the E340 connected to my homes mechanical chime as well. 2. Installation of the E340 was pretty easy since it was a swap from the Nest Hello.  3. It stores video on the HB3 which actually comes with some built in storage, however like the previous poster I also installed a SSD drive in my case a 4TB unit and I have had no issues with the E340 recording footage.  4. I do recommend it because it was fairly priced and the fact that there is no subscription fee for cloud storage is saving me money.    Some things I miss coming from the Nest Hello is the google home integration, when someone rang my doorbell the video feed would show up on my Nest hubs and I miss the 24x7 recording.  However I feel as though the Eufy has good compromises including great video quality and the video feed loads quickly so I am sticking with it for now.",1,1722978145.0

You can run the math from there. Keep in mind that night vision/IR LEDs will increase the draw dramatically - an array of LEDs when your full power budget is only 5w is probably going to be a significant portion of the power.  2. tl;dr - Yes it'll be fine. A lot of us ran these outdoors when they first came out, since their image quality absolutely obliterated the competition, and it was some of the first AI detection cameras on market. They still are pretty high up there in IQ. I run these outside to this day, and I have only had one two out of two dozen (this and its Pan and Tilt version) fail through the plastic lens flaking and bubbling away.

Literally every person I know either carries a backup battery, or drives a car, and throwing something in your glovebox would be pretty trivial, if you don't have any sort of bag you carry.

They were initially clueless about it, but on escalation one of their techs admitted that because of EU privacy laws they implemented the delete on anything over 90 days globally, but didn't inform users.    To this day, I have no events older than 90 days on my HB2 and have plenty of spare storage.  Prior to that I would keep older events on the HB thinking I could retrieve them any time.  Now, I scrub through and download anything I want to save once a week.  I have tested the tech's assertions by leaving events and noting the dates.  When an event is \~90 days old, it disappears.  Maybe HB3, with its greater storage, won't do this, but if its really based on EU privacy laws, it might still be in place.  Note that Eufy employs some kind of garbage collection code in the background, so when you mark an item for deletion, it may not go away until the garbage collector routine runs.

In my troubleshooting, I found that my firewall at home, specifically my IDS component, was blocking connection to a few AWS IP addresses. These happen to be the ones my cameras were trying to connect to. I removed the IPS from the blocked list and added exceptions and no longer have the issue.

1egazx5,lfr6z9i,lfr4up6,BulkyApproval,"Yea not the best choice of words on my part.   So you can run an app on your phone to analyze the spectrum at your house. Maybe there are unused bands that you can change your home wifi to. That will instantly help all your 2.4ghz clients.   I did the above. I also removed a couple of my wifi access points. Basically remove devices that are broadcasting radio frequency causing the interference. I also removed one of my homebase 3s for the same reason.  Is your house wifi like a big party where 50 people are talking loudly yet no one can understand anyone? You want your WiFi to be a quiet house where communication goes from source to destination without much effort. No need to yell, repeat, retry, etc   If your neighbors are affecting you, your options will be more limited.

This will cause some wifi devices to drop, some for a very short unnoticable duration (especially if they're not actively used, like a laptop thats not on), others longer (like these Eufy cams).  But as others have said, probably network first issue. For so many cameras to go offline at once, I'd start with the commonalities - the network in this case.

This makes it unreachable via app. Press the sync button and it wakes up, allowing you to use live view, change settings, etc. Once disconnected from live view, it goes back to that state after 10-30 seconds and becomes no longer reachable.

I have a spectrum analyzer that covers up to and including the 2.4 Ghz wifi band.  That makes it easy to see what channels are strongest in the area.  Even the free Wifi manager apps on Android or IOS will provide some indication of where the problems are coming from.    Eufy's hidden network can be found by looking for the MAC address starting with 8C:85:80.  That will tell you which channel the Homebase communicates on.

1eaovs4,len63y8,,ntsefamyaj,"I swear Eufy has the dumbest naming conventions to confuse everyone. Do you have the Eufycam 3 S330 or the 4G LTE S330? Regardless, range has always been questionable and varies based on lighting (brighter lighting generally results in farther range).  I workaround my Eufycam 3 S330 range deficit by using indoor motion sensors to triple the range. I ghetto weatherize the sensors using clear polyethylene 3""x3"" zip baggies and they've survived ice storms and heat waves for about 2 years now (replace 2¢ baggies every season). I set them up to capture lateral movement entering my driveway, yard, or walking paths. Recording is triggered by automation rules with Homebase 3 with a minor delay. This won't work with solo cams not controlled by Homebase.  While not 100%, it works more than 2/3 of the time, which allows me to hobble on with Eufy's deficiencies. I've tested other major brands also and have only been disappointed, so I'm amortizing my Eufy investment until a better brand or model comes along.",1,1721785810.0

So I did some testing inside my house with a spare Cam 3 S330 that I have not mounted yet. It seems the motion sensor is almost a direct line of sight. It detected me directly in front of it at about 25 feet (the furthest I could test inside) but if I stepped slightly to the side, less than 5 degrees off at 25ft it didn’t detect me even though I was still pretty much in the center of the frame.   This motion sensor is just complete garbage. Is there a way to do a software motion sensor? I guess it’s fine, just defeats the point of a camera if it misses most of the activity.",1,1721786676.0
1eaovs4,lentrlv,len8c03,ntsefamyaj,"Unfortunately, there are no software work arounds. They use lackluster motion detection logic. I do wonder if it's the PIR sensor or the camera/firmware botching detection. For your spare, you can test this by configuring for **all motion** and then repeat your test from the side. PIR sensors work best with lateral motion (sideways rather than forward/backward). If it continues to fail at detecting your side motion, then it's the PIR sensor sucking. If it works *on the all motion setting*, then it's the camera firmware (or Homebase) failing to recognize lateral humanoid motion.  PIR = passive infrared   The PIR sensor only triggers a scan of the previous moment of footage within the frame of the camera based on your defined motion. As to whether it actually detects and records anything depends on the built in software and Homebase properly recognizing that motion as defined in your configuration. If it doesn't detect the motion properly, it doesn't save/record and it probably won't notify you. But this unsaved footage sometimes manifests as phantom thumbnails on the Eufy app with no actual footage. It also drains your battery (e.g. warm foliage in the wind).",1,1721796185.0

To answer your questions:  Yep I did research.  Starting on apple’s site under “HomeKit friends” or something like that.   This is what turned me on to Eufy.  From there, I saw the “works with HomeKit” logo and that was that for research on the “does it work with HomeKit”.   Where I got snagged was when shopping on Eufy’s site, I clicked on the “what’s hot” or new.  It didnt enter my mind that Eufy would go backwards in their tech progression - however - (hindsight) none of their new equipment works with HomeKit.  Not the HomeBase or any of the new cameras.  Only the older low-def stuff.   As far as the multi-view goes.  Viewing multiple live-streams at once has been a cornerstone of every security camera system since they were created.   I guess I assumed that this cutting edge, software driven, AI enhanced security system would have the basic functionality of a 40 year old security camera system.   My bad - but come on.

I always responded to the same ticket, yet each new ""support"" rep I spoke with all seemed to ignore the previous conversations and asked me to go through the same troubleshooting steps.  In the end, they all agreed the units were defective, but wouldn't/couldn't do anything since the warranty had expired.  I never disputed the fact that they were out of warranty.  However, since 3 of 4 failed right around the warranty expiration, I was hoping for a bit better result.  The last person I spoke with offered me a 20% discount on a future purchase.  \*shrug\*  Now I'm just putting this information out there in case others with the same cameras run into a similar issue...  If you're within warranty, get them replaced ASAP.  It's interesting that you mention failures after a firmware update.  I don't know if/when the firmware was updated on these cameras and don't see a way to locate this information.  Would be nice to know if the failures coincided with a firmware update.  One of the ""failed"" cameras now reports ""new SD card detected"" warnings and keeps asking me to format.  Replaced the SD with a spare I had and still see the same warning, when it's not offline.  It's unfortunate as I had (still have thus far) a good experience with the other cameras and video doorbell.

According to the manual 8v transformers aren't even the correct spec, so it's entirely possible this transformer just doesn't not consistently deliver enough power to show up as charging.

Eufy is branded as HomeKit compatible, so I assumed it would work with HomeKit.  They should say “a handful of our older, low res cameras work with HomeKit”.    Also, it shouldn’t advertise as a security camera.  It should advertise as “records what happened for you to watch later and show the authorities”",2,1721330304.0

That is not just a recording device it is security. We use to not have this set with the alarm and yes, it was just a recording device we showed the police, but now it alarms us if someone is there. You can customize it for various cameras. We only have certain ones that trigger the house alarm.",3,1721348258.0

So, I tried to learn about the new products out there.  Eufy seemed like the modern, smart answer to the old NVR crowd.  I bought the shiny package.  3g cameras down the driveway.  Stand-alone cameras on the pier and out-buildings.  Indoor cams in the garages.  Everything is covered with an eero mesh network and so it seemed like a “wow - the future is amazing” solution.

1e6i56m,lduhby4,ldufyq9,jpcirig,"Good question.   I initially found it on the Apple website under “HomeKit friendly accessories” (or something like that).    From there, I started learning about eufy vs the other brands.   All of the eufy products used to be HomeKit friendly.   However, when you shop on eufy under the “hot new products” tab (or something similar again), they are all not at all compatible with HomeKit .  Every one of them.  I know it’s my bad not to dig into each one individually, however, in my simple mind, “eufy was taking the Apple friendly route”.   Also, when I ordered it, the website was different.  I received an email saying that due to high demand, my order will be delayed and all ship at once”.   I didn’t care, and I assumed that it wouldn’t go backwards in its compatibility.

If it’s as simple as a bigger battery and/solar panel…then great.  Do it.  I have a trail camera with a solar panel about the size of a sheet of paper and a cable that runs down to an external battery in a weatherproof box. My point is that is my decision.   My alternative was to keep the small panel and no ext. battery and deal with poor battery life (if I used live view too much).  Also - most eufy cams are hardwired.  I don’t think the hardware can handle live-streaming HD content.  Which is the same constraint every security camera faces.  So, the manufacturer splits the signal into HD and LD and all is well.

I'd like to use it to watch a fixed location which would be my driveway where cars are parked in case of an incident, that way I have a 24/7 camera (e330) and a camera that tracks people (s340) in order to maximize views.  I've thought about what to do for notifications for the potential e330 since I don't want literally double the notifications, so I've considered the possibility of turning off all alerts on just the e330 and using it as more of a ""reactive"" surveillance tool and not one that I would rely on to tell me initially that someone is at my home since I have others to do the same thing.

Cars passing down the street will trigger a motion event even though I've set the Activity Zone a fair distance from the curb. At the same, it won't trigger a motion event if I pull into my driveway slowly enough. So lots of false positives, but it misses plenty of real activity within the Activity Zone - the exact opposite of what you'd be hoping for.

I understand storing more video is beneficial to some people but my need would really only be for weekends away.. can I still access the motion recordings and save to phone if I really needed to keep the footage? Sidenote, are the phone notifications good?",1,1721079215.0
1e45lmj,ldfcnk5,ldct66i,MrMSUK,"Thanks for the message.  HomeBase is optional.  Added a E340 door bell a while back after the 1st S340, both works fine standalone (without homebase 3). I'll need to get the battery powered E340 door bell wired in at some point (this is optional, but required to enable 4 seconds pre-activity recording; imo also removes the fuff of charging). It makes bell noise on doorbell but didn't come with a Chime in my order (sometimes bundled). Eventually added the HomeBase 3 - which acts as a door bell (helpful as when it was only the outside door bell making the noise, it annoys neighbours). Imo these are fine without HomeBase 3, at some point when you see Homebase 3 on sale though (was the case with me), it'll be tempting to add it (it seems to make the camera work better in tracking).  Imo without the homebase 3, the main downside is a theoretical one, someone can walk up to the camera (e.g. door bell or S340 camera), steal it, and since footage is built-in, you won't have that footage. With homebase, footage gets stored on your own storage on HB3 (presumably inside the house, the external cameras/door bells can go missing, but you'd theoretically have the footage if lucky). Assuming the HB3 has electricity and internet throughout (e.g. UPS/celluar backed up) and they don't break in to steal the HB3 too or jam the wifi/cellular backup (but it's one thing to grab something external when nobody's around, another to break into a premise). I guess if those scenarios are a realistic concern, might be additionally helpful to have some local CCTV installer have a look for you at something more robust that Eufy.",2,1721122279.0

Will need to figure out how to keep it cleanly wired. Have electrician friend maybe get to ask them for input but so far the battery mode otherwise hasn't been bad. Imo the battery only mode is an okay temporary position until neat wiring could be sorted.  Definitely - I think the bell sounding external is a bit better than nothing, but perhaps not the best idea; imo it wakes up to the whole street if on the higher setting (I'm exaggerating), except yourself (if on the other side or have okay wall noise isolation).",1,1721228055.0

The farthest away from the HB3 is the SoloCam S340 which is about 35 feet away from the HB3. I have no problems with that connection but I do only see 3 bars of the WiFi signal icon on that one where I see all 4 on all the others which are a bit closer.

1e29lxh,ld3k7yw,,AirFlavoredLemon,"Quotes are the OP's questions.      1. ""footage is NOT sent to Eufy "" - Videos, no. Thumbnails - yes if enabled. App warns you about this.   2. ""camera has to be connected to a home Wi-fi?"" - Yes   2b. ""App is communicating directly with the camera and NOT through Eufy?"" - Not sure. There's likely still authentication through Eufy's servers, but the video stays local to your own device.   3. ""recording that I'm watching is downloaded from the camera"" - Videos, yes. Thumbail previews, no. Those are in Eufy's servers.   4. ""why do some threads in this sub said the cameras don't need to be connected to the internet?"" - Never read this. Honestly, one of the big issues is some cameras don't even record with no internet, but local Wifi is still functioning. Not sure if this is still a thing.   5. ""But I guess the camera itself has an IP or mac address? that would then give away its geographic location?"" I'm not sure if there's a question here. Your ISP provided IP address will give a general geographic location of you, any anything connecting to the camera will obtain that IP. Eufy will have this IP (and your general location) through your cameras (Home location) and the app (Cellular provided IP).",2,1720934445.0
1e29lxh,ld4bdh9,ld3k7yw,porcupine_snout,"Thanks. When they say there's E2E encryption, are they referring to between the camera and the Eufy App? I'm hoping that the authentication through Eufy's server is robust/fixed now.",1,1720951987.0
1e29lxh,ld5nzz8,ld4bdh9,AirFlavoredLemon,"When most companies say end to end encryption, they usually mean the data in transit. So things like Whatsapp, Telegram - the data is encrypted in transit so any connections between the ends can't read the data.  I'm not 100% firm on this, but one of the two eufy leaks was an publically accessable, insecure, AWS S3 bucket (storage server). This contained all of the thumbnails you get on notification in the app. (This was discovered/publiczied the same time as the Eufy stream leak - the ability to see other people's cameras).  Eufy's app warns you now - you can (always) choose the verbosity of your notifications. Thumbnails can be enabled or disabled, and if its enabled - Eufy App now warns you that cloud storage WILL be used for thumbnails - and confirms that you are okay with this.  Also encrypted data and streams are only useful if the key or any form of decryption or authentication isn't easily accessible. Almost all data is encrypted at rest now, in the cloud, by default. But if the AWS S3 bucket   (storage server) has no password, or the Eufy-online-website has an easy to crack key; encrypting the data is worthless.",1,1720973816.0
1e29lxh,ld00ye0,,OhSoSally,"Im not going to go through line by line but I think I understand what you are asking...so here goes based on my experience.  They will record and store events on the SD card regardless of being connected to the internet. I have tested this a few times inadvertently. Note: you will not get a compilation of events sent when they are reconnected to wifi. You have to look in the app.  Your events under the events tab will not be playable unless the camera is powered on and connected to a network. The exception is events that also go to the cloud.  You can not remove the SD card to view events, if your camera is not on its original network you can not view any videos. So, if someone takes your camera they have to erase the SD to set it up on their network.   So technically you could set up a camera on your home wifi, take the camera to another location, provide power and it should continue to record events and will overwrite the SD card when it runs out of space until you connect it back to your home network, then you can see what is on the cameras sd card. I have not tested this, I have 1080p cameras that record 24/7 and will overwrite a 64G SD card every 4 weeks.

1e29lxh,ld06rgs,ld00ye0,OhSoSally,"One more thing I forgot about you asking. Most likely the stand alone cameras go through the servers when viewing. The app needs to be authenticated.

I believe the events recorded through a camera and stored on an attached eufy hub does not go through the servers. You would want to search posts here, I am sure it has been discussed multiple times.

1e21kjn,lcywroe,,pmarksen,"To save battery, they have a PIR sensor in the bottom part. The camera sensor is off normally. My understanding of the sequence of events is:  1.	PIR detects motion.  2.	Camera turns on, and sends recording to Homebase.  3.	Homebase analyses the recording to see if it’s a false alert or not. 4.	If the Homebase decides it’s a valid activation, it will alert you.   So with your setup, there are a couple of issues: the cars are blocking the PIR and limiting your area of ‘detectable’ movement. PIR movement sensors work better with movement across the field of view rather than directly towards or away from the sensor. Your movement is directly towards the camera/sensor. The cars blocking the area will likely mean the Homebase will need a longer recording to decide if it’s real movement or not, especially if you have human detection turned on.   The activity zone is really only for the Homebase part of the process, and won’t affect the PIR initial detect as far as I know. That makes me think your PIR isn’t positioned well or is having some other issue. Turn up the sensitivity all the way and make sure you have compared your setup to the recommended distances and angles from Eufy.   The reasons the recording is only from the rear wheel is a combination of the PIR activating late and then the Homebase taking a little bit to get and process the recording.",3,1720864376.0

Also note that some solar panels CAN be mounted away from the camera.  It's just a USB-C cable between them.  The cameras like S340 that come with a solar panel support you mounting them separate, so if there's direct sunlight around the corner or up higher that's still an option for you.  Having to manually recharge cameras is a PITA.  Important note -- Guest access features are universal (because it's app based and doesn't matter which camera you're sharing).  Guests are required to register an account and use the Eufy app just like you.  The biggest challenge is going to be with notifications.  Notification settings are done PER CAMERA, so either you turn on notifications and everyone gets them or you keep it off and no one does (or your guests sign out of the Eufy app normally and only log in to look at a camera as needed).",1,1720569534.0

1dz6f9r,lcore6v,,Fat-Taff,I'm unsure but would like to help.    Firstly I would ensure you are indeed recording to the harddrive. I believe others have had problems with the same setup as yourself using both SD card and HB data drive.  Secondly you are aware that all data stored on your hard drive is encrypted and may not be able to view on other devices.  Thirdly if it's an absolute must to back up then perhaps external USB sata drives is the way forward as you would be able to log dates and details etc and catalogue your drivers and they are cheaper than an internal HB drive.  Fourthly you are aware that continuous recording is indeed capable on data drives but event recording is recommended to prolong the life of the harddrive.,3,1720711704.0
1dz6f9r,lcp2bbf,lcore6v,jflowers,"Thanks so much for this.  1) How would I double check that I am recording to the HomeBase 3's ssd that I installed?  When I open a camera's setting in the iPhone app, I see ""HomeBase Connection"" and when I click on this, says that I'm ""Connected"" and I see that the radio button for ""Continuous Recording and Events"" is selected.  Is this what I should see for the video feed to be continuously recorded to the ssd?      2) As for the encryption - that I'm interested in learning more about.  I assume that the keys are tied to the device via an installed secure enclave?  Or is this in the ""OS"" and the keys are not behind a trusted execution module of sorts.        3) I don't mind hot swapping 2.5"" drives ( if I must ) - and I'm more concerned as the video archive function in the app only moves events.  But then, how to go back and review a particular time in the future....  4) Again, I don't mind swapping out new ssd's from time to time and storing them.  The problem I'm trying to solve - what if you are presented with a claim in the future.  E.g.:  My dog pooped on the sidewalk last year ( she didn't but...).  And I don't have that event ( because she didn't) - still the other party could then say that perhaps my dog didn't trigger an event, small dog.  Being able to provide that entire day's video might assuage these concerns.",1,1720715238.0
1dz6f9r,lctfy9j,lcp2bbf,Fat-Taff,I'm not that technical to be honest so as for encryption I couldn't comment. I have noticed through my app that it seems you can only backup events but perhaps some could enlighten us further on wether this option will back up continuous recording. You can actually view through the app and record via that when viewing part continuous recording so perhaps you need to do that so it becomes an event in not sure on that either to be honest. Slight confusion for me is you say you go to your camera settings when I feel you should be going to your home base settings perhaps. I believe others have had issues when swapping drives and putting them back in also.  I'm sorry I can't be of more help to you but I'm sure you can ask this and other forums a single question at a time and get the few answers you seek individually to build up the best way forward for yourself.   My setup is only set to record events on my drive and as I don't have the same requirements as yourself per say I hadn't come across any solutions for you.  ATB.,1,1720782426.0

I decided to buy a new HB from Amazon, and it has the same problems with my S300 and E330 (having to climb up to the roof to unmount cameras to add them back to the home profile).  And so, i tried the reset button again, same problem.  My HB became defunct / malfunction again (the light on the unit is red and never turn green after hitting (2 minutes of holding down) that reset button.

But it wasn't a big deal to add ""launch eufy security, wait 1 second, return to Home screen"" into the list.  I started leaving the eufy security app in the background again and it isn't chewing a ton of battery, so maybe they fixed it. It definitely seemed to get a lot worse (my phone device was below 20% when I'd normally expect to be at 60% or so, and eufy security was 80%+ of that).  They should be relying on the OS to tell the app when I've come or gone from a defined area, but at least at one point it looked like they were polling the location in the background.  I'm actually a bit surprised Google doesn't do a good job of this, the OS should be able to figure it out since it has raw access to the wifi and bluetooth signals (of everything in the area) and motion detection (you aren't coming or going anywhere if you aren't moving, etc).",1,1720233925.0

Granted, it's facing the street but I adjusted it where it doesn't record traffic or anything. Plus my old Ring doorbell 2 was exactly in the same spot. I'm pretty disappointed with the battery life. I even turned down sensitivity, etc.  Also the app has issues showing events where I get a notification but when I try to refresh the event list, it still doesn't show the new events. Closing the app and launching it fixes it sometimes.  Actually, I figured it out, the app stops updating the event list on mobile data somehow. As soon as my phone is connected to wifi, the events are refreshed normally.   I wanted to add that I have the Homebase 3 as well.  1 more thing, I bought a replacement battery so I can swap it with a charged battery any time the one in the E340 is low, so that rules out issues with the battery since it's 2 brand new batteries with the same battery life.",1,1720270778.0

The trick is to remember that you can't touch/drag in from the top or bottom edges of your phone (based on the current orientation), so create it as large as you can, position the dots for one corner and also the top or bottom edge roughly how you want, and drag the whole thing toward a corner, when you push into the corner it will reshape to fill that corner.  Now carefully push and hold on another dot, then drag it slowly in a direction that won't cause the whole thing to hit an edge (and resize) to test to see if you are dragging the right spot, and if so, drop it where you want.  You can drag a dot into a corner but you won't get riiiight to the edge without squishing the whole box. You can drag a dot to the top-center or bottom-center, but you can't move it from there (the OS grabs the tap, rather than the app).  You might be able to use accessibility options to disable those touch zones, I'm not really sure, I just curse and grab my iPad when I need to tweak.  It's a genuinely terrible UI.

Works great once you weatherize them. Mine have survived direct sunlight, blizzard snow conditions, sleet, and summer heat. I don't understand why Eufy doesn't just sell a purpose made outdoor motion sensor.   Just use automation in Homebase 3 to setup triggers and recording. The downside is you can't customize which types of motion to record. The sensors are dumb and will detect most motion. Just adjust sensitivity, height, and angle to reduce false positives. This method increases effective detection range about 3x farther and catches all foot and vehicular traffic into my driveway, including deliveries and late night prowlers.  I use alarms at night paired with external sirens and Eufy automation camera sirens, so the additional range means the prowler can be scared off before they get in range to do damage.

I know there's also generally issues with the solar models and coatings on the panel.   But overall, they're okay as a manufacturer. They could be way better, but I'd rather Eufy over something like Ring.  As for your question for recommending another brand - it depends what you're looking for. If you're replacing wired cameras - I'd recommend looking into Reolink. They're cheap, have sharp lenses, have a nice varied lineup to get the exact cam you need for a location.

That helps too.,1,1719232045.0
1dnaf27,la1wqc3,,fryrpc,There is general advice in the installation instructions to allow you to get the most out of the PIR - these include choosing the right installation height to control the effective range of the PIR and also installation angle so that objects cross the PIR side to side - PIR's are not good when an object travels towards the sensor and are really designed to trigger when an object passes across the sensor.  If I mounted mine at the front door facing forward to the road then it would not effectively pick up visitors to the front door. If I mount mine to the side of my front door pointing towards it then it picks up visitors as they walk from the pavement to my front door. The difference is how the object is passing the PIR.  You need to be aware that PIR will be limited in range so you have to give it the best chance with height and angle - it is used to trigger the camera to wake up fully and start recording - the PIR trigger method is better at battery conservation. Generally powered cameras can use either PIR or compare a live image real time for pixel changes > X% to trigger.,1,1719238918.0

As I mentioned the disconnected camera's footage is now hidden from the default view of the events timeline but if you wanted to view it or view it in context with other footage you would select DISCONNECTED CAMERAS along with any other camera footage you wish to view on the timeline and it will appear properly and in order.  https://imgur.com/CotnORq  The only thing i have left to do is manually reset the old camera.

And I mean the old models stay reliable or better, and the newer models are improved. Better image quality, way better automatic tracking, faster click-to-view-livestream loading times.  That being said, their battery powered, IR-triggered cameras are pretty much unusable. This isn't just unique to eufy; just all current battery powered cameras from all brands.

Homebase 3 (along with its claimed support for wired indoor cameras) is also a huge letdown. Unstated camera limits (10 wired cameras, who knew) along with promised but then cancelled features (Facial recognition on wired cameras - i bought the cameras with that intent).  I do think their updates are more beneficial than detrimental, and its probably one of the best things Eufy has over anyone else (actual feature drops and improvements). Are they unstable, crappy, and are we essentially beta testers in a production enviorment? Absolutely. Almost Tesla like in execution. But it does mean we often have quick fixes to bugs (not all of them) and new features and performance improvements on old products. Overall? Not a good methodology for whats supposed to be an always-on  security system that's supposed to have predictible performance. Great for video games.  Tl;dr - Eufy has some hits. Most of their products are lacking and not dependable. Eufy's updates are overall a net positive for the product; but not once its in operation.

Eufy likes to paint you as crazy, but it's a thing.   I say it's a combination of changes in seasonal lighting, wind, and Eufy logic. I've alway suspected Eufy uses cloud processing for some or all of their so called AI motion detection whatever-whatever (which is why if you block internet at the router, motion activated recording stops working after some time). My suspicion is that Eufy changed something that triggered this unwanted behavior. I see it all the time since I have over 20 cameras and it's very, very annoying. Since these issues crop up with no changes to the firmware (phone app version should have zero bearing on the issue), the only explanation is something on the Eufy cloud end.

I'm fairly new to the Eufy world, had cameras for a little over a month but only had a HomeBase 3 for a couple of weeks. I've had a couple misidentifications but they were pretty close (and there was no great shot of the individual in the entire video).  Until last night.  Now I've had several in a row. One of them was a ""Yeah, okay, not that far off"" even though I've got a few dozen videos of the misidentified person in the past (and the other person is me). Today a older man with grey hair and a beard was identified as a black haired female friend... Like I realize facial recognition isn't exactly a perfect science, but this isn't even close.  Also odd, I had a package delivered that I grabbed from the door before the courier was back in their vehicle (within a minute or so). About 45 minutes later I got a notification that my package was picked up, with a video showing no movement and no package.  Looking back, the HomeBase 3 does seem to have grabbed new firmware yesterday so that just might be it. All of these issues have been on cameras that have been in place for a while, I also added a new one to the garage and I'll wait to see how it reacts before passing judgement (but it's fine so far).

However, I've observed the automation route to be unreliable, delayed, and buggy sometimes both for alarming and disengaging an active alarm. This gets progressively worse the more devices you have setup for Homebase 3.  Another less buggy option is to use the modular Eufy siren T8970, which can be configured to alarm either via mode or automation. It activates over sub 1G wireless and is significantly more responsive turning on/off. However, AFAIK it can only be configured to beep loudly (rather than wail like a siren) and Eufy hasn't implemented any ways to delay alarms (only applies if you utilize the alarm delay feature).

Besides that method, simply have to wait for the Internet to come back then check the event history in the app.   Everything was functioning as normal and no events during that 12hr period were lost.

That would quickly drain the battery in days.  They also do not record continuously for the same reason.  You need something powered 24/7 to get reliable sound detection.  The indoor 2k cam is a cheap reliable solution because it will record continuously and also trigger a sound event when the dog barks.  I have used that cam to record the neighbors dog when it barks.

1dd1swp,l824z57,,electro-zx,"The doorbell cycles charging from the AC source to keep from overcharging the batteries.  The point where it starts charging is based on things like number of detections, recording time, and temperature.  As long as your battery stays above 40-50% you shouldn't have an issue.  I've seen mine cycle down as low as 45% and then start charging and charge to around 85%.    I added a switch at the transformer, so I could open that and see the true state of charge without the transfomer in the circuit.  Even bought an AC ma meter to insert in the circuit, but the doorbell is almost 4 years old and still going strong without any issues so haven't installed it.  Only time I check on state of charge is just before cold temps start.  This is because the doorbell won't charge below 32F to prevent destroying the batteries.  As long as you have a good charge before the freeze starts it has always survived the winter.  If it looks to be drawing down the battery in the winter, you can always cut back recording time to reduce draw.  If that doesn't work, then you will have to remove it and bring into the house wher its warm to charge.",1,1718072828.0

Seems like a lot of people are going to want those features enabled, but you lose half the resolution doing so.      Others seem to limit recording to 1080 under the guise of saving space, seems ridiculous. The whole point of better cameras is better resolution, at least let the user choose what resolution they want to record at.",1,1718058532.0

1dcq2zx,l83chte,,Whole_Marionberry757,"I’ve found that it works pretty well to use scheduling to toggle when I receive notifications from specific cameras. For example during the day, I just want notifications at the front of the house watching the driveway but I want the other outside cameras to flag events without notifications. I also use cross camera tracking so that the front driveway will send the notification and then “stitch” in the camera tracking down the side of the house which doesn’t send notifications. I don’t really care to capture notifications in the backyard so I just have the camera set to flag humans, pets, vehicles (just in case!) but not send notifications. This way I can be out in the backyard without getting notifications every few seconds. Sometimes we have something going on in the front of the house triggering notifications, in those instances I have a group controls setup on the main screen of the app that allows me to silence all cameras, so the events are still flagged but notifications are turned off. One last way I control this is to use iOS focus modes, I have one setup that silences notifications from the eufy app. This allows me to silence notifications for a timed period without having to toggle anything in the eufy app. I’d recommend the HB3, I think that the features that it offers are worthwhile.",2,1718098853.0

Only way that fixes it for me is to hit the speed button, but then you end up missing the event and then it again needs to buffer again to ""decrypt""--they worked much better without this ""feature"". It has been complained about plenty of times before by other people, yet Eufy refuses to implement the simple solution (i.e. allow people to turn off their broken/buggy ""feature"").  Also, there's so many examples of Eufy dropping the ball on simple features. How is it that the garage cam has no highlighted events (the timeline is yellow when motion is detected), yet every single other camera when playing back from the timeline shows events highlighted in yellow?

You can add a Homebase to your network which allows for long term local storage of your videos without paying a Cloud subscription. The Homebase also adds extra functionality such as AI and facial recognition if it's supported by your camera. The Homebase comes with 16GB of built in memory that allows you to store video events locally - or you can add an additional disk drive to this of up to 16TB and this will allow you to record 24/7 if your camera supports it. Generally for most people with a couple of cameras a 1TB or 2TB drive is sufficient for months, if not years, if recordings.  If you want to go with the simple SD card option you use the app on your mobile to access the recordings on your SD card while it is in the camera - no need to physically go to it as it is connected via the network.

As far as I'm aware you cannot have 24/7 recording to an SD card so it will only record when events are triggered detected (someone correct me if I'm wrong!). It then depends on the video quality and the length of the recording clip as to how many clips / events can be recorded.   I use the 16GB built in memory in my Homebase 3. I have 2 cameras attached - a E340 dual lens pan and tilt floodlight cam and an E340 dual lens video doorbell. Both these have 2 lenses so I assume the video files take up slightly more space than a single lens camera. My Homebase has recording going back to the start of April.

1d98y59,l7e70qj,,ntsefamyaj,"This isn't exclusively a Eufy issue. You're likely experiencing flash memory gotcha failure. There are a limited number of times a flash memory cell can be used before it goes bad. Here's an explanation that is mostly relevant.   https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/4de0yu/eli5_why_does_flash_memory_have_a_limited_number/  For whatever reason, Eufy bundles standard 32 GB SD cards even though dashcams and security cameras require **high endurance** flash memory for frequent read/write operations. This is especially true if you have a small capacity card, or are using continuous recording. There is no permanent solution, because SD cards are doomed to fail eventually by the nature of the technology. So to offset this, do two things.  1.) Use only high endurance SD cards from reputable makers and sellers. I use Samsung high endurance 128 GB cards for my 5x system critical cameras and the cheaper Sandisk or other name brands high endurance cards for non-critical cameras. The Samsung cards can be had for much cheaper during sales on Amazon, so don't pay full price if you can wait. I use Google Chrome's built in price tracker to notify me of sales.   2.) Get the largest card you can afford. The larger the card, the less frequently the same memory cell will be reused, reducing the failure rate.  I have two dual front/back dashcams in two vehicles and run into the same issue. One is 2K and the other is 4K. The solution is the same. I've bumped my devices to 256/512 GB respectively with Samsung high speed endurance SD cards and haven't had any issues in 2 years.  It's a pity Eufy doesn't support higher capacities beyond 128 GB.  TLDR; flash memory has a limited number of read/write operations, so stick to high quality high endurance cards.",2,1717691475.0

To my understanding, it’s just sending the video and log of the device during (or maybe near/slightly before and after) the event. So if I report a misidentified event in the basement I just make sure it doesn’t catch me checking the dryer while bare ass.😆  If I had kids or any cameras in my living areas then I’d definitely be more concerned about the event donations. I’ve chosen to instead go with CVR cameras recording to a homebase, no cloud, surrounding the outside of the house.  The basement one is to lazily check the washer/dryer and also because I really wish I would’ve had something to send me a notification when my water tank burst several years ago.  The cats have a camera on their food dish that I can check if I want to look at parts of the kitchen and I’m much more concerned about the privacy of that but it’s also CVR with no cloud storage.

I do this from time to time using my backup router or cellular hotspot while doing maintenance. As far as I'm aware, Eufy doesn't lock on to the router MAC address This requires knowledge of the SSID/password and also knowledge of how to configure your specific wireless router.   If you aren't familiar with the new or old router setup, you'll need to take the device down to setup again according to the new router documentation.   Using a button on a wireless router to setup a new device sounds great on paper and makes it easy for non-technical people to connect things, but it uses *generated* or factory defined settings. You'll probably never remember these settings years down the road, and most of the time they don't even tell you what settings were used. This means you are out of luck for future setup and troubleshooting and will need to get the ladder out to remove the device and redo everything.

And on the rarest, the Eufy app tells you the SD card is full and that you should re-format it; something that shouldn't happen since the cameras is supposed to delete the oldest footage to make room for new footage. Also keep in mind that your footage is stored with the device, so if it is an outdoor camera then it could potentially get stolen and you would have no evidence.

This isn't perfect, but Eufy won't acknowledge wrongdoing or fault. They play the ""the customer is crazy"" game. I don't bother contacting them anymore except for system critical issues.   **TIP:** I trigger my critical outdoor Eufycams with hacked indoor sensors, so they record almost always 3x farther out.

1d3e32m,l68wvfs,,electro-zx,"I have 12  2C & 2C pro cams with a mix of different software updates, but all show as current.  I have noticed that the change of ambient temperature plays a part in how my detection works.  As temps warm up, my detection sensitivity declines slightly.  I might have to tweak sensitivity up a notch on most of my cams.  Guessing that higher ambient temps make it harder to distinguish objects from the background.  The reverse happens when temps cool down.  PIR circuits usually have some kind of temperature compensation, but Eufy may not have enough to keep things stable over a wide range of temperatures.    That said my cams have been pretty stable in detection capability over the 3+ years I've had the system.  I do have a couple of motion sensors to trigger critical cams and they always work and don't seem to require any tweaking.  One tip when siting your cams is look at what the background will be.  If you site your cam so that its looking directly at something that gets warmed by the sun like a deck or walkway, it can retain that heat and make it harder to detect moving warm objects.  Also, make sure your cams are looking for objects that move across the field of view instead toward or away from the camera.",1,1717024147.0

1d38695,l66kb5y,,ntsefamyaj,"Unfortunately, there isn't a way to set a fixed limit for video retention days. So the short answer is no.   As mentioned by the other community member, you could play with storage size, but this isn't perfect. If you're using a battery cam that does motion activated recordings (all **Eufycams** named models fall under this), there is no fixed storage size for estimating storage requirements on a real world clock of 72 hours. The total amount of storage used varies by activity levels. So for example, a ton of activities one week will generate more content than an idle holiday week and so it would be disproportionately larger.  The exception would be for continuous recording devices (usually corded cams), which support recording on a fixed schedule, or 24/7. If motion activated recording is turned off on a corded cam, then the continuous recording storage size should be almost the same every time. I say almost, because video footage varies also by some other factors depending on the codec and compression levels, which process colors and footage differently. However, if motion activated recording is *simultaneously* enabled, it will add on top of the continuous recording footage and change up the storage size.   As for why it's not available, that would be great feedback to Eufy. It would be nice for certain use cases. I've had this come up as well, but had to live with the smaller storage workaround.",1,1716994358.0
1d37dvi,l66lms4,,ntsefamyaj,"AFAIK there are no Eufy models that support Homebase 2 with continuous recording capabilities. In addition, Homebase 2 has only a fixed 16 GB storage. This might be sufficient for photos, but will run out very fast with continuous recording of videos.   Your best bet may be to use something like a corded Outdoor cam model that supports SD cards. Max the storage out (usually 128 GB). Corded outdoor cams generally support continuous recording mode. Just turn off any sort of motion detection, motion activated recording, and notifications.

Or they just designed it stupidly to feel out customer frustration. This is a major design flaw that only Eufy can address.  >thief could just steal an exterior camera and all the recording of the thief doing so would disappear with the camera.  Yes, unfortunately. Eufy Support never did/could answer my question on that. The answer would be to either a.) secure the camera far, far out of each, or b.) use a bait/backup camera, or c.) use a different brand altogether.  >it seems the clips are stored on Eufy servers, not my devices (I don't have any memory cards in my devices).  Again, I suspect the encryption/decryption utilizes the serial number or something on the device. So even cloud footage will need this to decrypt.   >It's like it goes into some hibernation mode until it wakes up due to being plugged in.  Yes, most likely. Try waking it up by pressing and holding the power/sync button without plugging in first. It's a major hassle to fetch a mounted camera to plug in again. My guess is that it lost connection and went into power save hibernation like a lost Mars rover. This implies you have some 2.4 GHz wireless interference or range issues. You can prove this by bringing the device closer and run it for awhile here to see if it still drops the connection. There are a few potential solutions for wireless interference. 1.) position the camera closer. 2.) move objects out of the path between the wireless base (wireless router or Homebase) and the remote camera. An alternative is to move the base altogether for better reception. 3.) especially remove any reflective objects or mirrors in the immediate path between the base and the remote device. 4.) For a non-Homebase device, test a different router.  If budget isn't an issue, you could work around this by extending the network using either an access point or separate router placed specifically for the problem cameras. You could also run ethernet cabling or use a PoE/HomePNA type extension to add an access point closer to camera. To reduce 2.4 GHz overhead, turn down the output (power) of the radios if your wireless equipment supports it.  Unfortunately, I see the hibernation problem with other brands as well. They use similar hibernation logic. I just had that happened a few days ago for my non-Eufy beehive cam so I share your frustration.

Things are working great after you've settled on Eufy's limitations and have accepted what it can/can't do, but then suddenly **BAM!** the camera starts doing ridiculous things. No rhyme or reason. Supposedly, motion detection logic is processed locally on the device (but I strongly disagree and suspect it's cloud based). The sudden behavior suggests someone broke something.  These issues may go away in time, but you'll need to adjust your settings and accept the new reality until either they (silently) fix or revert what they broke. Usually, this involves lowering sensitivity and forgoing missed detections.   I'm living with several false human detections that occur every day in the same spot around the same time, lighting, and weather conditions. They all started in the past week.

1d0ww6r,l5ulp94,l5tiiyv,thedaveCA,"Spinners use more power and generate more heat constantly, SSDs only when writing (and erasing).  Consumer SSDs aren't great if you intend on overwriting content on a mostly full drive, but they should be fine for write-once (plus random reads). If Eufy hasn't implemented TRIM and doesn't zero out space, the SSD write performance will drop significantly when the drive gets full (unless the drive has firmware that understands the file system, but I don't know that any drives do this at this point).  For my part, I'm using an SSD I had on hand, it should last well over a year before anything needs to be deleted. If I can't confirm whether Eufy uses TRIM then I'll probably pull the drive, TRIM the whole thing and let it start over, as I rarely need older videos (and of course, will grab what I might need). Their format command might do the trick even if it doesn't TRIM real time. And it might.  eufy does seem to recommend SSDs as a valid option.  Obviously usage patterns will have a huge impact here.",1,1716790906.0

1d0ij3f,l5nq7pg,,Mystikalrush,"In my experience no it does not. In fact, it makes things slower. Loading live stream, accessing video archives and controlling a movable camera got much slower (delay/lag) vs directly to my WiFi.   Think of the home base as the middle man. It's what bridges the connection to each camera connected to it and then to your WiFi router. So it's a multi step process which causes delays. Where if you skip the middle man and go directly to the router for each camera it removes a step entirely.  The only reason I'm keeping and dealing with the slowness is the increased addable storage and those files are stored locally to the home base. For example, if someone ripped off and stole your devices entirely it will have those video files recorded to the home base, inside your home. Where as without it, you need the camera in range again, connected and then you can access those video files.",5,1716669537.0

1d0ha03,l5pcjau,,senaiboy,"1. No issue so far with mine (almost a year of use) with a  2TB SSD. You can do without HB3, as the cameras also have local storage (SD card) to record onto - however with S330 you'll also lose some functionalities without HB3 (some AI recognition, etc).   2. I've received notifications and accessed the recordings remotely (even halfway across the globe) with no issue. As long as your home's and device's internet connection are both stable enough, there shouldn't be any issue.   3. Battery cameras work by having a PIR sensor to constantly check for movement, and when triggered it'll then startup the camera to start recording. There will ALWAYS be a 1-2 seconds delay, this is the disadvantage of having battery cameras. The only way to capture everything is having wired cameras do 24/7 recording. However, I have never had issue with the delays because my cameras pick up the subject before they get close enough anyway.   4. Very rarely, but it's due to my phone's unstable internet connection not the eufycam system. Note that some owners have reported issues with connections but that's not my experience.   5. The cameras have local storage to record onto. When reconnected to the WiFi it'll transfer it into HB3, as far as I understand.   6. There are different modes (energy efficient, etc) and you can also manually set how long it should record for. However I find this very unreliable, and often my recordings stop too early (typically 30s to 1 minute recordings). Again, this is a disadvantage of battery cameras and you should not expect them to capture everything every time. Get a wired camera with 24/7 recording if that is essential.   7. No issue with my WiFi but my house isn't that big and I have access points.   8. Can't complain about battery life. It lasted all through UK winter without running out of battery and constantly at 100% from solar charging rom spring to autumn. Obviously this is placement dependent and how much sun your cameras are getting.   9. Main issue is to know about the disadvantage of having battery cameras as above, and tailor your expectations (that said, the system has exceeded mine as a complete novice to home security). If you absolutely need to record every detail, you are better off investing in a 24/7 wired camera system.",3,1716697097.0
1d0ha03,l5qfmuf,,A_SuperTomato,"I will start by saying I own 4x S330 and 4x E330 pro cameras (as well as other Eufy cameras).  Others have answered the question well, I will just add:  Don’t waste your time on the S330 kit. Get the E330 pro 4 pack with HB3 if you are going Eufy. You need power nearby each camera which is a downside.  Why? With the S330 cams being battery they don’t record continuously and rely on a motion sensor (PIR) to detect movement.  If the motion is out of range you get no recording. They also start late at times also.  With the powered E330 pro's you can go back in time and see what you may have missed. With the S330 you cannot as they are sleeping only until recording occurs.  This happens a fair bit so you miss what you need. Also clips max out at 2 minutes with a 5 second pause between clips. This means you also miss events if you need them.  The battery runs down fast if there is constant motion and or trees / cars etc in view.  If there is Wi-Fi interference nearby the cams will not work correctly and go offline and so on.",2,1716724796.0

You're the first one to notice it so you need milk.  Who has the specific milk you need?   You know the milk is carried by Target. That's you. You are the DNS server right now. First in the chain.  Then you go to Target's website, picked your store. Target is the 2nd DNS down the chain.  You go inside Target and then pick up a jug of milk. That's not generally recorded by DNS because that's a specific resource. DNS only handles domain names (target.com). It doesn't record (target.com/product/fancymilk.html).  What if they don't have the milk in that store? They can redirect you to another Target store a few miles down the road that has milk (redirect) so you might have a different lookup somewhere in DNS now.  Then your firmware changed...what if we replaced a broken ice maker in your fridge because it was busted? Or maybe fix the seal on your fridge door?

ClamAV and SpamAssassin (as examples) use a version number in a DNS TXT record and when the client notices the contents have changed it goes to download the latest ruleset. This is actually really efficient because DNS records are tiny, and are cached by the resolver (so multiple devices asking the same question around the same time get an answer locally)  Whether Eufy does anything like this or not? I have no idea. It might just be that they don't have much of an internal DNS cache (or Eufy uses short TTLs with autoscaling resources or something).

1czlcex,l5i1qh0,l5hpbj9,dathar,"The fun part is that you can't easily. Not for a consumer anyways. You don't control Google's DNS server. Or your ISP's, or Cloudflare, or whatever you decide to use or funnel to. It isn't generally encrypted so you can put something in between and snoop on it.  Fun part about DNS is that it is a massive chain of DNS servers for little sections everywhere. You can insert your own DNS servers with appropriate forwarders out to the world. Then you snoop on your own DNS server and see which of your clients generally asked for what domain. Note that a URL isn't a domain so you won't ever see a full URL. Just a basic ""who are you and what are your addresses"".   Then there's some fanciness of ""you're allowed to skip your own assigned DNS and directly ask another DNS server stuff"". That's why you can do something like      nslookup www.google.com 1.1.1.1  and it'll go look at CloudFlare and skip your regularly-assigned DNS like your ISP.  You can (not easily on consumer gear) shove all of outgoing DNS traffic through your own DNS server and break that chain.  Like ""all outgoing traffic on port 53 goes to my DNS server, except if my own DNS server asks stuff (because you set it as a forwarder, needs to go out and ask for stuff it doesn't know)"".   So basically, you:  * Roll your own DNS server. Something like pihole is the easiest to use and set up since it is an all-in-one package of UI/tools. You can run this on a VM if you don't have dedicated gear to run it. It has its fancy web portal where you can look up which clients requested what. Bonus points is that you can filter out a lot of known ad servers and malicious servers from ever being resolved so they just break. * Change your DHCP to assign your pihole as a DNS server. Don't assign any secondary DNSes because they don't fall in order of query. * Force all outgoing port 53 traffic (except pihole itself) to the pihole. That way you capture all DNS requests on the pihole itself  Keep in mind this is about generic DNS. We won't get into DNS over HTTPS or DOH.

1cxycyc,l57vp1i,,electro-zx,"If change the setting to see the live view, it won't record.  You get one or the other, not both.  The reason it's late is the doorbell uses PIR motion detection and that takes a few seconds to wake the doorbell when it detects motion.  After that, if you have Human detection selected, the clip  is filtered by the AI and that takes some time.    Eufy makes a wired doorbell that is powered continuously and allows a 3 second pre-roll on detection.  You lose the battery power, but it might fix your late pickups.  The fact that you have your camera wired doesn't give you the pre-roll because your doorbell only trickle charges the battery instead of directly powering the doorbell.  I have the battery doorbell and installed a motion detector that fires off immediately and sends an automation trigger to the doorbell and a porch cam.  Nobody is fast enough to escape detection with this setup.  I get full face on shots of anyone coming to the front door.  It may not be ideal for all front door geography, but work great on mine.",1,1716407282.0

1cxpxfc,l59ezmq,l57chvz,thecx5dude,Yeah I'm thinking it's the software limiting it to 50% for better battery health or very slowly charging it up to max. I heard some people just wire charging the cam to 100% then letting the solar panel maintain it.,1,1716428347.0
1cxpxfc,l5na9yx,l59ezmq,electro-zx,"The software won't limit it at less than 100%.  Its more a function of battery drain versus charge current.  The Eufy panels only source max \~500ma in full sun, so they have trouble if the camera has more detections than Eufy's normal 10 per day or you have the recording set to custom and draw more from the batteries.  In that case, they will fall behind and eventually have to be manually charged.  It is a good habit to charge to 85-90% on the usb charger before hooking up the solar panel.  That should limit number of times you have to manually top up the charge.    Also, when temps get colder, the cameras stop charging at \~32 F to prevent destroying the battery, so make sure your batteries are topped up before temps drop.  If you don't, you will have to take the camera down and warm it up inside before charging.",1,1716662990.0

1cx4ay2,lhfgse3,lhbb53b,CommodoreLuna,"Unfortunately I never got round to testing it.  One issue was power requirements, I've seen some people say 10w isn't enough to charge it faster than it drains (Somewhat dependant on sunlight levels), and after passing 5v DC to something like 12v AC you'd be lucky to get 5w after inefficiencies. I did consider ripping apart the solar panel to see if there's a voltage regulator I could remove to stop it wasting power by first stepping the voltage down to 5v, but I didn'#t want to potentially ruin a good working panel. I might try it again if I can find something like a 20w non-USB solar panel.  The other reason I put the idea on hold was simply I wasn't sure what AC frequency would be required, or whether a square wave would work rather than a typical sine wave (Cheap inverters are almost always square wave). Being designed for house mains transformers which probably have the same input and output frequency I'd guess 50hz (UK) would be suitable, and I'd wager it has a pretty wide tolerance anyway.

Lithium batteries don't like being kept at full charge and this will stress the batteries and reduce the number of cycles you will get from a battery pack. If you keep the battery cameras continuously charged at 100%, you will find that at some point, your battery will stop taking charge.    Several things can play a part in how long the battery pack will last when keeping it plugged in continuously.  1.  If your camera has a lot of traffic and long record times, this will limit the time spent at 100%.  2.  Use a smaller capacity charger or limit the charge current so that the camera stays below 100% SOC in normal operation.    3.  Use a smart plug on your charger to only allow the cam to charge to around 85% before shutting down the charge.  You will have to monitor the cam SOC manually to accomplish this.
