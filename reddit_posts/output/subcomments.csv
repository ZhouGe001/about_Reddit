lk2qxd6,,SMEACS,"And this is my problem with Eufy. Prime example.  They release great hardware, but their software development side let's them down. I've owned Eufy products for over 5 years. In that time I've seen functions that worked brilliantly out of the box get removed and features become broken with updates.  S330 smart lock door - HDR removed after update S330 Floodlight camera - tracking of objects Eufy Garage Cam - continuous recording only in 1080p  Eufys video format - not true 2K or 4K resolution and terrible bitrate.  We are essentially beta testers for Eufy. Crowd funding on a release to market product.  Don't get me wrong, love my Eufy cameras, but it icks me everytime I see a feature removed/broken as a result of an ""update"".   They need to take notes from Tesla, add features rather than remove/break things on each update.",3,1724706920.0
ljx542r,,VegasRealty,"This is just a suggestion and a complete guess, but try this anyway.   Connect the Homebase 3 to your router using an ethernet connection. Go into the app settings and change the recording to ""continuous recording"" like you had before. Now connect the Homebase 3 wirelessly to your wi-fi and disconnect the ethernet wire. At this point your Homebase should be wireless and connected to wi-fi. Now go into the app and check if your settings for ""continuous recording"" are still chosen.  Again, this is a total guess of this will even work. I'm just thinking that maybe the ""continuous recording"" option has to be chosen during the ethernet connection setup process first.   Hey, it's worth a shot. Try it out and reply back to this comment so I know if my thought process is correct!",3,1724621879.0
ljyshpj,ljx542r,Moonlord_,That actually did work.  It let me switch back to continuous mode while on Ethernet. I unplugged it and it automatically reverted back to wifi but the continuous recording setting remained enabled.  It is still greyed out with the warning that continuous recording won’t work on wifi but it is selected and appears to be working normally regardless.   I guess I’ll just make sure not to change it and hope that it sticks for a while.,3,1724646352.0
lk4f8ks,ljyshpj,perfectdetent,"So essentially, their recommendation worked and without a whole lot of headache.",1,1724729946.0
ljxjzhm,,AirFlavoredLemon,Holy what. This is awful. Can you ask Eufy to push out a custom rollback firmware for the HB3? I heard some rumblings about some other cameras having a custom firmware pushed out for them.,2,1724627495.0
ljysnul,ljxjzhm,Moonlord_,It wasn’t a firmware change…it was an update to the app (I’m on iOS).,1,1724646442.0
ljyym2i,ljysnul,AirFlavoredLemon,"If its not a firmware change, can you just log in on an android phone with a slightly older version of the app and reenable it? I'm not sure how the app could randomly change those settings otherwise.",1,1724649782.0
lk1akh4,ljyym2i,Moonlord_,"I have no idea how I could get an older version of the app.   The app store just has the current version to download.  As for changing the settings I think an accidently did that myself.   There was a pop-up when I went into the settings regarding not working on wifi and I think I hastily hit the wrong selection instead of “cancel”.   That being said I did get it re-enabled for now using VegasRealty’s suggestion in this thread. Plugging Ethernet in temporarily allowed me to switch it back and then the setting remained when I switched back to wifi.  You just have to be sure not to change it because it won’t let you switch it back, although I imagine they will eventually patch out this loophole.",1,1724690078.0
ljyah7y,,Somebodysomeone_926,You can get an Ethernet over powerline kit or a router that supports WiFi bridge mode.  Powerline would be easier if you don't have IT experience.,2,1724638273.0
ljweqzi,,thesweatervest,"You can get a generic wifi to Ethernet bridge for like $20, and that’s might resolve that until Eufy fixes the bug.",1,1724612865.0
ljyyatr,ljweqzi,wongl888,I don’t think it is a bug judging from the warning/error messages I received every time I unplug the Ethernet connection on my HB3 (and it reverting to WiFi connection).   Suffice to say that Eufy must have received a number of customer complaints regarding continuous recording using WiFi and hence putting a stop to it. I guess in the long run better for Eufy to provide a reliable configuration rather than one that might not work for some customers (or works unreliably)?,2,1724649596.0
lk19v3l,ljyyatr,Moonlord_,Yeah doesn’t seem like a bug…the warnings saying that you can’t store continuous recordings when on wifi were obviously intentionally written and placed there.  Also Eufy support echoed it and mentioned that it needs to be on Ethernet as well.   I just can’t understand why.   The cameras still send/store their video to the Homebase wirelessly regardless of how the Homebase is connected.  It doesn’t use the Homebase’s connection to the router to store video. What does the Homebase being on Ethernet or wifi have to do with anything?  That only comes into play when you’re trying to view footage from the Homebase and that’s the same for every camera.,2,1724689853.0
lk1idnl,lk19v3l,wongl888,"We do not know the architecture of the HB3. It is entirely possible that when connected by WiFi instead of Ethernet, the HB3’s WiFi might be degraded, possibly due to having to share its WiFi bandwidth with the camera and its “backhaul” to the router to connect with the Eufy servers/app.   (I use the term “backhaul” loosely here to illustrate the principle in Mesh routers losing one radio channel for their databackhaul between the mesh nodes when using WiFi backhauling ).",2,1724692556.0
ljxk6fl,,exilepa,Could try getting an ethernet over power line kit to get it working until Eufy fixes this.,1,1724627570.0
